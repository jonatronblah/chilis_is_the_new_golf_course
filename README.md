1. A jupyter notebook used to scrape officequotes.net for structured, labeled quotes from office characters.

2. a CSV file of the raw scraped data.

3. Preprocessing and model training code used to model the data and export saved models.

4. A flask app to load the various models, predict on new data and display results.
