Dwight:," Yeah, you said... ",no1-03.php

Dwight:, I can handle that.,no1-03.php
Michael:," OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",no1-03.php

Jim:," OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.",no1-03.php

Michael:," Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",no1-03.php
Jim:, Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,no1-03.php
Pam:, I'm inventing new diseases.,no1-03.php

Jim:, Killer nanorobots?,no1-03.php
Pam:, It's an epidemic.,no1-03.php
Dwight:," The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] ""Count Choculitis""",no1-03.php
Jim:, Sounds tough.,no1-03.php
Dwight:, Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,no1-03.php

Dwight:," Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.",no1-03.php
Oscar:, I'm reporting you.,no1-03.php
Dwight:," You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.",no1-03.php

Dwight:, We'll be here waiting for you. ,no2-03.php
Michael:,"  Oh, man. ",no2-03.php
Dwight:," A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people. ",no2-03.php

Pam:," In English, box of paper snowshoe racing. ",no2-03.php
Jim:,"  Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton. ",no2-03.php
Pam:," The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. ",no2-03.php

Carol:, Who told you that?,no2-03.php
Michael:,"  As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here. ",no2-03.php
Michael:,"  There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down. ",no2-03.php
Carol:," Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom. ",no2-03.php
Michael:,"  No, no, no. ",no2-03.php
Carol:, That's some extra income for you.,no2-03.php

Michael:,"  Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities. ",no2-03.php
Dwight:, I don't even know what to say.,no2-03.php

Dwight:," Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. ",no2-03.php

Michael:, Eh.,no2-05.php
Dwight:, Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.,no2-05.php

Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? ",no2-05.php
Dwight:," Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. ",no2-05.php

Jim:," Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline.

Dwight:," I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.",no2-05.php
Dwight:, Go. Get the door.,no2-10.php
Michael:, Here we are.,no2-10.php

Michael:, Did it work?,no2-10.php
Kevin:," [holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?",no2-10.php
Michael:," A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.",no2-10.php
Kevin:, But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?,no2-10.php
Michael:," Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.",no2-10.php
Jim:," So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",no2-10.php
Angela:," Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?",no2-10.php

Angela:, We'll see.,no2-10.php
Ryan:, Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.,no2-10.php
Michael:," [comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?",no2-10.php
Angela:, Fifty.,no2-10.php
Michael:, Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.,no2-10.php
Michael:," It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",no2-10.php
Michael:," I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.",no2-10.php
Pam:, You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.,no2-10.php

Darryl:, Who cares?,no2-10.php
Michael:," Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.",no2-10.php
Dwight:," Michael, I would like to be the elf.",no2-10.php
Michael:, That makes sense because he has elfish features.,no2-10.php
Dwight:," [now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so.

Toby:, I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.,no2-10.php
Oscar:," I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.",no2-10.php

Michael:, I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.,no2-10.php
Jim:, Yeah?,no2-10.php
Michael:, I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.,no2-10.php
Jim:," Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",no2-10.php
Michael:, Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,no2-10.php
Jim:," That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .. ",no2-10.php
Michael:, It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.,no2-10.php

Creed:, That's from me.,no2-10.php
Jim:, Great. Where did you get it?,no2-10.php
Creed:, I don't know. It was so long ago.,no2-10.php
Jim:," He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.",no2-10.php
Creed:, Yep. That's exactly what happened.,no2-10.php
Dwight:, Pam.,no2-10.php
Pam:," [opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",no2-10.php

Phyllis:, I knitted it for you.,no2-10.php
Michael:, An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out],no2-10.php

Kevin:, Should we just keep opening up the presents?,no2-10.php
Dwight:, We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,no2-10.php
Michael:, I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,no2-10.php
Jim:, What is Yankee Swap?,no2-10.php
Michael:," One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",no2-10.php
Jim:, I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,no2-10.php
Pam:," Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",no2-10.php
Michael:," Well, I call it fun!",no2-10.php
Oscar:, Why are we doing this?,no2-10.php

Angela:, It sounds mean.,no2-10.php
Michael:," Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.",no2-10.php
Angela:, Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry],no2-10.php
Michael:," Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",no2-10.php
Meredith:, I'll take the teapot.,no2-10.php
Jim:," Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",no2-10.php

Pam:, I'll take the iPod.,no2-10.php
Ryan:, And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?,no2-10.php
Dwight:," Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",no2-10.php

Meredith:, I'll take the oven mitt.,no2-10.php
Michael:," Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",no2-10.php
Michael:," Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",no2-10.php
Michael:," [opens present] ""In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.""",no2-10.php

Dwight:, Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,no2-10.php
Jim:, Got to be kidding me.,no2-10.php
Dwight:, Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,no2-10.php
Michael:, [after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?,no2-10.php
Pam:, Maybe because you hated her present so much.,no2-10.php
Michael:, Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,no2-10.php
Jim:," Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",no2-10.php
Stanley:, And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.,no2-10.php
Michael:," Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",no2-10.php
Oscar:, You got a bonus check?,no2-10.php

Liquor Store Clerk:, It comes to $166.41.,no2-10.php
Michael:," All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",no2-10.php
Liquor Store Clerk:," Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.",no2-10.php
Michael:," Cool, cool. Box it up.",no2-10.php
Jim:," I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",no2-10.php
Dwight:, No trades.,no2-10.php
Jim:," Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",no2-10.php
Dwight:,<i>Titanic.</i>,no2-10.php

Dwight:, No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,no2-10.php
Jim:, You don't even drink tea.,no2-10.php
Dwight:," True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. ",no2-10.php
JIm:, Okay .. ,no2-10.php

Roy:, This is awesome.,no2-10.php
Pam:, I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.,no2-10.php
Roy:," Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.",no2-10.php
Pam:, So what are you going to get me instead?,no2-10.php
Roy:," I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.",no2-10.php
Michael:, Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,no2-10.php
Angela:, What is that?,no2-10.php
Michael:," This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.",no2-10.php
Meredith:, We can drink?,no2-10.php
Toby:, We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.,no2-10.php
Michael:," Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",no2-10.php
Meredith:, Me. Please.,no2-10.php

Dwight:," Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.",no2-10.php
Phyllis:, I'm bringing someone.,no2-10.php
Dwight:, Really?,no2-10.php

Dwight:," Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.",no2-10.php
Pam:," Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.",no2-10.php
Dwight:, Absolutely... not.,no2-10.php
Dwight:," What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.",no2-10.php
Oscar:," Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.",no2-10.php
Michael:," Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.",no2-10.php
Oscar:, I'll take the tea pot.,no2-10.php
Meredith:, Damn it.,no2-10.php
Kelly:," So, I guess, you really didn't want the shower radio that bad. No, I just like tea.",no2-10.php
Oscar:," No, I just like tea.",no2-10.php
Kelly:," I don't know why Oscar didn't like the gift. I know he wanted a shower radio. I mean, I totally remember him telling me that he wanted one.",no2-10.php
Oscar:," Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.",no2-10.php
Michael:," Oscar, paint ball pellets.",no2-10.php
Oscar:, I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.,no2-10.php
Pam:," It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.",no2-10.php
Meredith:, Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?,no2-10.php
Michael:, Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party],no2-10.php
Toby:," So, hey, you wanna trade?",no2-10.php
Kelly:," Yes, totally, 'cause I was just gonna throw this out anyway.",no2-10.php
Toby:, Really? You were gonna throw out a book?,no2-10.php
Kelly:, Mmm-hmm.,no2-10.php
Kevin:," [Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man ",no2-10.php
Darryl:, Yeah.,no2-10.php
Kevin:, [singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.,no2-10.php
Kevin:, I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.,no2-10.php
Dwight:," I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.",no2-10.php
Ryan:, I actually got that for you. I had you originally.,no2-10.php
Toby:," Oh, cool. It looks really interesting. What did you end up with? [Ryan pulls Creed's old coat out of a bag] Sorry.",no2-10.php
Ryan:," I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.",no2-10.php
Toby:, Christmas.,no2-10.php
Ryan:," Yeah, Christmas.",no2-10.php
Oscar:, What did you end up with?,no2-10.php
Creed:, Your shower radio.,no2-10.php
Oscar:, You like music at least?,no2-10.php
Creed:, I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.,no2-10.php
Oscar:, You're kidding. What was your DJ name?,no2-10.php
Creed:, Whacky-weed Creed.,no2-10.php
Oscar:, Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.,no2-10.php
Angela:, You behaved very badly tonight.,no2-10.php
Kelly:, Sorry?,no2-10.php
Michael:," See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, ""Man, I wish I got that."" I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.",no2-10.php
Jim:, Hey.,no2-11.php
Dwight:, Hello. Jim?,no2-11.php
Jim:," What's up, buddy?",no2-11.php
Dwight:, This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,no2-11.php
Jim:," Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.",no2-11.php
Jim:," Who, Steve?",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.",no2-11.php
Pam:," Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.",no2-11.php
Pam:," Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.",no2-11.php
Pam:, I love these.,no2-11.php
Dwight:," Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?",no2-11.php
Jim:," Oh, there it is. J1.",no2-11.php
Dwight:, But I don't have any... ,no2-11.php
Jim:," Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," [putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... ",no2-11.php
Michael:," Hello, everyone.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Good morning, Michael.",no2-11.php
Phyllis:, Where are we going this afternoon?,no2-11.php
Michael:, Ah! Ha ha ha!,no2-11.php
Pam:," Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.",no2-11.php
Jim:," ""It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.""",no2-11.php
Pam:, A ski mask and a swimsuit.,no2-11.php
Jim:," So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.",no2-11.php
Pam:, And brush our teeth.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Yeah?,no2-11.php
Stanley:, Michael.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Stanley! Bo banley.,no2-11.php
Stanley:, I need to know... ,no2-11.php
Michael:, Banana fana fo fanley.,no2-11.php
Stanley:, What we're doing.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Be my mo manley.,no2-11.php
Stanley:, You said bring a toothbrush.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Stanley.,no2-11.php
Stanley:, Is this an overnight?,no2-11.php
Michael:," Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?",no2-11.php
Stanley:, Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?,no2-11.php
Michael:," Maybe, I don't know.",no2-11.php
Stanley:, Not maybe. Yes or no.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",no2-11.php
Stanley:, In January?,no2-11.php
Michael:, It's cheaper.,no2-11.php
Michael:, This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.,no2-11.php
Michael:, It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!,no2-11.php
Meredith:, All right!,no2-11.php
Ryan:, I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?,no2-11.php
Michael:," No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",no2-11.php
Ryan:, I'm already in business school.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, this... ",no2-11.php
Kelly:," Wait, Michael?",no2-11.php
Michael:, Yeah?,no2-11.php
Kelly:, Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?,no2-11.php
Michael:, To throw you off the scent.,no2-11.php
Kelly:," Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",no2-11.php
Kelly:, I took the tags off already.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Who is this smart little cookie?"" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",no2-11.php
Michael:," I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Leader... ship. The word ""ship"" is hidden inside the word ""leadership,"" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",no2-11.php
Oscar:," Last year, Michael's theme was ""Bowl over the Competition!"" So guess where we went.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",no2-11.php
Darryl:, How about the sales department is the sails?,no2-11.php
Michael:," Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",no2-11.php
Phyllis:, A furnace?,no2-11.php
Jim:," Yeesh, how old is this ship?",no2-11.php
Pam:, How about the anchor?,no2-11.php
Phyllis:, What does the furnace do?,no2-11.php
Michael:," All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",no2-11.php
Jim:, I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,no2-11.php
Michael:, Titanic?,no2-11.php
Pam:, I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,no2-11.php
Michael:," No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",no2-11.php
Jim:," Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",no2-11.php
Phyllis:," Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.",no2-11.php
Michael:," No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",no2-11.php
Darryl:, What?,no2-11.php
Michael:," The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Aye aye, Captain.",no2-11.php
Michael:," [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",no2-11.php
Dwight:, Cool.,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.",no2-11.php
Michael:," I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.",no2-11.php
Michael:, Okay.,no2-11.php
Michael:," In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Hey, look! I'm king of the world!",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.",no2-11.php
Michael:," And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Okay! So... ,no2-11.php
Michael:, Okay! So... ,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Please. The life preservers.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Right.,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.",no2-11.php
Michael:," But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here... ",no2-11.php
Michael:, I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna... ,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Okay, Michael, if you don't mind... ",no2-11.php
Michael:, Rock it!,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Please, okay? ",no2-11.php
Michael:," If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Michael.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Yep.,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?",no2-11.php
Michael:, We're all gonna have a good time tonight!,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?,no2-11.php
Michael:, Hm? Okay. Yep.,no2-11.php
Katy:," You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?",no2-11.php
Roy:, Yeah.,no2-11.php
Katy:," Pam, were you a cheerleader?",no2-11.php
Roy:," No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!",no2-11.php
Katy:, That's hilarious.,no2-11.php
Jim:," It's not hilarious, but... ",no2-11.php
Roy:, Where did you go to school?,no2-11.php
Katy:, Bishop O'Hara.,no2-11.php
Roy:," Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?",no2-11.php
Jim:," Um, no.",no2-11.php
Katy:," Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!",no2-11.php

Michael:, Having fun?,no2-11.php
Brenda:, Yeah. Everybody's really nice.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",no2-11.php
Brenda:, When are you going to start the presentation?,no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!",no2-11.php
Michael:," So, okay.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Limbo, whoo!",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?,no2-11.php
Meredith:, Me.,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Okay... ,no2-11.php
Dwight:," Me! Me, me, me.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Uh... usually it's a woman.,no2-11.php
Dwight:, I'm stronger.,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!,no2-11.php
Dwight:," I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!",no2-11.php
Michael:," But before that, I have to do my presentation.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Nope! Dance contest!,no2-11.php
Michael:," All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate! ",no2-11.php
Michael:, Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.,no2-11.php
Dwight:, [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,no2-11.php
Angela:," Hey, come inside and talk to me.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!",no2-11.php
Darryl and Katy:, [chanting] Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!,no2-11.php
Roy:," Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!",no2-11.php
Pam:," No, I'm not going to do that.",no2-11.php
Roy:, Come on!,no2-11.php
Darryl:, That's what I'm talking about!,no2-11.php
Pam:," Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?",no2-11.php
Roy:, I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!,no2-11.php
Pam:, It's getting kind of rowdy down there.,no2-11.php
Jim:, Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!,no2-11.php
Pam:, Sometimes I just don't get Roy.,no2-11.php
Jim:, Well... ,no2-11.php
Pam:," I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?",no2-11.php
Jim:," Oh, um... [A long silence.]",no2-11.php
Pam:, I'm cold.,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," So, what's this presentation all about?",no2-11.php
Michael:," Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Women and children.,no2-11.php
Michael:," No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, That's a stupid analogy.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.",no2-11.php
Dwight:, Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Okay.,no2-11.php
Dwight:," Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.",no2-11.php
Katy:, I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?,no2-11.php
Pam:," Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?",no2-11.php
Jim:," Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, He's just sucking up! ,no2-11.php
Roy:," When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.",no2-11.php
Jim:, You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,no2-11.php
Roy:," Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!",no2-11.php
Michael:," I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",no2-11.php
Roy:," No, it was Captain Jack.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:," We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!",no2-11.php
Michael:, Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,no2-11.php
Pam:," No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.",no2-11.php
Michael:, Then I'll give you away!,no2-11.php
Pam:," No, thank you.",no2-11.php
Katy:, Do you think that'll ever be us?,no2-11.php
Jim:, No.,no2-11.php
Katy:, What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?,no2-11.php
Jim:, I don't know. Let's break up.,no2-11.php
Katy:, Whoa. What?,no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.,no2-11.php
Meredith:, Wow!,no2-11.php
Dwight:, Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.,no2-11.php
Brenda:, Really? What?,no2-11.php
Michael:," Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a... ",no2-11.php
Captain Jack:, Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?,no2-11.php
Michael:," It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.",no2-11.php
Michael:," I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",no2-11.php
Michael:, Is somebody there?,no2-11.php
Jim:, What happened to you?,no2-11.php
Michael:, Captain Jack has a problem with authority.,no2-11.php
Jim:," Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",no2-11.php
Michael:," He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",no2-11.php
Jim:, What a night.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",no2-11.php
Jim:, She was always engaged.,no2-11.php
Michael:, Roy said the first one didn't count.,no2-11.php
Jim:," That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so... ",no2-11.php
Michael:," Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan... ",no2-11.php
Jim:," Yeah, I know.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.",no2-11.php
Jim:," Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.",no2-11.php
Jim:, She's engaged.,no2-11.php
Michael:, BFD. Engaged ain't married.,no2-11.php
Jim:, Huh.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Never, ever, ever give up.",no2-11.php
Dwight:," Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.",no2-11.php
Michael:," It's a fake wheel, dummy.",no2-11.php
Phyllis:, Are you all packed?,no2-11.php
Kelly:," Yes, I brought my duffel bag and a sleeping bag.",no2-11.php
Oscar:, Where do you guys think we're going?,no2-11.php
Kelly:, Definitely some place you can swim.,no2-11.php
Oscar:,  Right.,no2-11.php
Phyllis:, Maybe Florida.,no2-11.php
Kelly:, Did you hear something?,no2-11.php
Michael:, [knocking] Yeah.,no2-11.php
Jan:," Hello, Michael.",no2-11.php
Michael:, Hello. ,no2-11.php

Jan:, Brenda.,no2-11.php
Michael:," Oh, every man's dream.",no2-11.php
Jan:," Oh, really? A surprise visit from his boss?",no2-11.php
Michael:," Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...",no2-11.php
Jan:, A booze cruise? What do you mean?,no2-11.php
Michael:," Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...",no2-11.php
Jan:," Michael, we discussed the IRS's regulations.",no2-11.php
Michael:," Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.",no2-11.php

Jan:, All right. Let's talk about clothing.,no2-15.php
Phyllis:, I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.,no2-15.php
Jan:," Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.",no2-15.php
Angela:," I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.",no2-15.php
Roy:," I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like ""When are we going to go on a date-date?""",no2-15.php
Guy:, I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement],no2-15.php
Darryl:, I hate that too.,no2-15.php
Kevin:, That sucks so much.,no2-15.php
Guy:, It totally sucks.,no2-15.php
Dwight:," Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like ""Gas ain't free!""",no2-15.php
Lonny:," Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.",no2-15.php
Michael:, I feel you.,no2-15.php
Darryl:," No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?",no2-15.php
Dwight:, Not literally.,no2-15.php
Darryl:," You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.",no2-15.php
Michael:, Yes.,no2-15.php
Darryl:, We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,no2-15.php

Dwight:, Word.,no2-15.php
Roy:, Like next to no benefits.,no2-15.php

Roy:, Exactly.,no2-15.php
Michael:," It blows. It blows, man. Gah... ",no2-15.php
Darryl:, You know this would not happen if we had a union.,no2-15.php
Roy:, That's what I'm talking about.,no2-15.php
Michael:," No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",no2-15.php
Roy:, Absolutely.,no2-15.php
Darryl:, That's what we need.,no2-15.php
Guy:, You know you're right.,no2-15.php
Darryl:," Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.",no2-15.php
Michael:, You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,no2-15.php
Darryl:," It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?",no2-15.php

Michael:, Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,no2-15.php
Darryl:," Union! Union, yeah.",no2-15.php
Michael:, The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,no2-15.php

Michael:, Yeah-es.,no2-15.php
Darryl:, Welcome to the warehouse.,no2-15.php

Michael:," [knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points... ",no2-15.php

Jan:," Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means... ",no2-15.php
Phyllis:, Mistake.,no2-15.php
Meredith:, Slip.,no2-15.php
Jan:," Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.",no2-15.php
Kelly:, What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?,no2-15.php
Jan:, Excuse me?,no2-15.php
Kelly:," I mean that's a baseball term, right?",no2-15.php
Jan:, I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.,no2-15.php

Jim:," It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?",no2-15.php
Pam:, Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,no2-15.php
Jim:, Did you really?,no2-15.php
Pam:, No. [laughs],no2-15.php
Jim:, Oh.,no2-15.php
Pam:, Almost.,no2-15.php
Jim:, Good.,no2-15.php

Jim:," Nice. Well, what's it all about?",no2-15.php
Pam:, Um...,no2-15.php

Jan:, I'm divorced.,no2-15.php
Phyllis:, That must have been hard.,no2-15.php
Jan:, It was. Yes.,no2-15.php
Kelly:, You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.,no2-15.php
Jan:, I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.,no2-15.php
Phyllis:," Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.",no2-15.php
Angela:," At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.",no2-15.php
Jan:, Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.,no2-15.php

Michael:," Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...",no2-15.php
Jan:, Excuse me.,no2-15.php
Michael:, I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some... ,no2-15.php
Jan:," Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.",no2-15.php
Pam:, Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.,no2-15.php
Jim:, So you're not doing it.,no2-15.php
Pam:, How did you know?,no2-15.php
Jim:, Why not?,no2-15.php
Pam:, Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,no2-15.php
Jim:, Come on.,no2-15.php
Pam:, Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.,no2-15.php
Jim:, Roy said that.,no2-15.php
Pam:, What? You have something you want to say?,no2-15.php
Jim:," You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",no2-15.php
Pam:," Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!",no2-15.php
Jim:, You are?,no2-15.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no2-15.php
Pam:," It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .",no2-15.php
Michael:, I'm just going to put this over there.,no2-15.php
Darryl:, This is not a good idea right here.,no2-15.php
Michael:, You did uh... okay.,no2-15.php
Michael:, Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?,no2-15.php
Michael:," Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.",no2-15.php
All the Men:, Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.,no2-15.php
Michael:," Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.",no2-15.php
Michael:, Thank you to our hosts.,no2-15.php
Darryl:, Hey Michael. This ain't over.,no2-15.php
Michael:, Ahhh! Excellent.,no2-15.php
Michael:, Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,no2-15.php
Pam:," Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.",no2-15.php
Michael:," Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.",no2-15.php
Pam:, You did?,no2-15.php
Michael:," And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.",no2-15.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no2-15.php
Michael:, There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.,no2-15.php
Pam:,  Okay.,no2-15.php

Pam:, How about that one?,no2-15.php
Michael:," No, no. [blues piano playing]",no2-15.php
Jim:," Oh, that one was good.",no2-15.php
Michael:," Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, ""I am so lame."" Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... [imitating jackhammer] You know what I'm talking about?",no2-15.php

[Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now.

Jan:, Fine Michael. Thank you. ,no2-16.php
David:, OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to... ,no2-16.php
Jan:," Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.",no2-16.php
Josh:," So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. ",no2-16.php

Josh:, Thank you.,no2-16.php
David:," OK, Michael. ",no2-16.php

Michael:," [video dialogue for ""The Faces of Scranton""] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on. ",no2-16.php

Michael:," [video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, ""Great Scott!""]",no2-16.php
Michael:, Questions? ,no2-16.php
David:," Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.",no2-16.php

Kelly:," Yeah, it would be so great if he was.",no2-16.php
Jim:," Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",no2-16.php
Kelly:," Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]",no2-16.php
Dan:," And that about does it, thank you. ",no2-16.php
Jan:," OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,",no2-16.php
Craig:, Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.,no2-16.php
Jan:," Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?",no2-16.php
Craig:," I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal. ",no2-16.php
David:," So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch? ",no2-16.php
Craig:," That is correct, yes.",no2-16.php
Jan:," Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?",no2-16.php
Craig:," Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.",no2-16.php
Jan:," Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch. ",no2-16.php
Craig:," Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]",no2-16.php

Jan:," NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.",no2-16.php
Michael:, No you're not.,no2-16.php
Jan:," Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.",no2-16.php
Michael:," Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...",no2-16.php
Jan:," Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?",no2-16.php
Michael:, Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.,no2-16.php

Pam:, Hey. ,no2-16.php
Roy:, You almost ready to go?,no2-16.php

David:, You understand this is a very serious situation.,no2-16.php
Michael:," No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]",no2-16.php
David:, You made a joke?,no2-16.php
Michael:," I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]",no2-16.php
David:, Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss... ,no2-16.php
Michael:," I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again. ",no2-16.php

Michael:," Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? ",no2-17.php
Kevin:, I always set it at 69. [snickers],no2-17.php
Pam:, Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.,no2-17.php

Dwight:," [bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms].

Dwight:, No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists] ,no2-17.php
Crowd:, [claps],no2-17.php
Dwight:," Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is... ",no2-17.php

Michael:, You would not believe what happened here.,no2-17.php
Dwight:, What? Something happened?,no2-17.php
Michael:," Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",no2-17.php
Dwight:, Weird.,no2-17.php
Michael:," Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'",no2-17.php
Dwight:, Con artist.,no2-17.php
Michael:, She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,no2-17.php
Michael:," Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys? ",no2-17.php

Jim:, Goggles?,no2-17.php
Dwight:, [imitating '80s rock],no2-17.php

Michael:," That's it? You're going to end with ""etcetera""? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...",no2-17.php
Dwight:," Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?",no2-17.php
Michael:," That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.",no2-17.php
Dwight:, It is?,no2-17.php
Michael:, It's your delivery...,no2-17.php
Dwight:, What is?,no2-17.php
Michael:, Our biggest worry.,no2-17.php
Dwight:, I don't follow.,no2-17.php
Michael:," My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]",no2-17.php

Michael:," See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.",no2-17.php
Dwight:," Well, that didn't go well. ",no2-17.php

Melissa:, So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.,no2-18.php
Michael:," No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. ",no2-18.php
Abby:, That's not fair. [the rest of the kids agree],no2-18.php

Michael:," [to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like? ",no2-18.php
Michael:," I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake. ",no2-18.php
Michael:," I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan? ",no2-18.php

Dwight:," F. Alright, what's the damage?",no2-19.php
Delivery Boy:," Uh, thirty-nine sixty.",no2-19.php
Dwight:, [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.,no2-19.php
Dwight:," Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. ",no2-19.php

Angela:, No. ,no2-19.php
Michael:, Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.,no2-19.php
Michael:, was the worst birthday I think I ever had. ,no2-19.php
Jim:," So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back. ",no2-19.php
Pam:, Sixty-nine cup of noodles. ,no2-19.php

Angela:, Fine.,no2-19.php
Dwight:, What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?,no2-19.php
Angela:, Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.,no2-19.php

Kevin:," No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.",no2-19.php
Michael:, Are you done? ...Good. Okay.,no2-19.php
Dwight:, Here we go. Make a wish.,no2-19.php
Michael:, Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles],no2-19.php
Dwight:, Yaoo yay! [claps],no2-19.php
Michael:, ... I asked for trick candles.,no2-19.php
Dwight:, Pam was supposed to get 'em.,no2-19.php
Michael:," Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. ",no2-19.php
Angela:, No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.,no2-19.php
Michael:," ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].",no2-19.php
Pam:, [checking watch] We should probably head back.,no2-19.php
Jim:, Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,no2-19.php
Pam:, You dare me? How old are you?,no2-19.php
Jim:, Just... quit stalling.,no2-19.php
Pam:," [over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. ",no2-19.php

Pam:, Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ,no2-19.php
Jim:, How old are you?,no2-19.php
Pam:, I hate you. ,no2-19.php
Toby:," [to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.",no2-19.php
Michael:, There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.,no2-19.php
Kevin:, Still scary.,no2-19.php
Michael:," Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",no2-19.php
Kevin:, Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.,no2-19.php
Michael:, And laughter... also.,no2-19.php
Toby:, I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.,no2-19.php
Michael:, Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.,no2-19.php
Toby:, I work here. ,no2-19.php
Michael:," [mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",no2-19.php
Kevin:," If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.",no2-19.php
Michael:," Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.",no2-19.php
Dwight:," Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.",no2-19.php
Jim:," Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.",no2-19.php
Dwight:," Please, don't.",no2-19.php
Jim:, You... owe me.,no2-19.php
Michael:," Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. ",no2-19.php
Stanley:, Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday? ,no2-19.php
Michael:, How dare you sir. You are gross. ,no2-19.php
Michael:, [sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.,no2-19.php
Dwight:, I'll get someone to take it down.,no2-19.php
Michael:," No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!",no2-19.php
Kelly:, Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!,no2-19.php

Jim:, Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by],no2-19.php
Dwight:, YEAH!,no2-19.php
Pam:, Who is that?,no2-19.php
Jim:, Is that Michael?,no2-19.php
Michael:," Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.",no2-19.php
Pam:, I got it.,no2-19.php
Michael:," Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",no2-19.php
Jim:, ...It's something to think about.,no2-19.php
Kevin:," I can't relax about it, you know?",no2-19.php
Michael:, Kevin. You heard anything yet?,no2-19.php
Kevin:," No, not yet.",no2-19.php
Michael:, Okay. Well. Live strong.,no2-19.php
Kevin:," Okay, Michael.",no2-19.php
Michael:, Alright.,no2-19.php
Carol:, Michael?,no2-19.php
Michael:," Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...",no2-19.php
Carol:," Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.",no2-19.php
Michael:," Oh, these... all your kids? ",no2-19.php
Carol:, No just the front two.,no2-19.php
Michael:," Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? ",no2-19.php
Carol:, Sure.,no2-19.php
Michael:, Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!,no2-19.php
Michael:, Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.,no2-19.php
Kevin:," Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.",no2-19.php
Michael:," Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].",no2-19.php
Michael:," Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.",no2-19.php
Kevin:," This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.",no2-19.php
Michael:," Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",no2-19.php
Dwight:, Turn it around. Turn it around.,no2-19.php
Michael:, Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.,no2-19.php
Dwight:, Number one!!,no2-19.php
Michael:, Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.,no2-19.php
Pam:, Michael? ,no2-19.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no2-19.php
Pam:, This is from all of us. ,no2-19.php
Michael:, Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it. ,no2-19.php
Pam:, Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.,no2-19.php
Jim:," Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.",no2-19.php
Dwight:, Let's get the party started.,no2-19.php
Michael:," That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]",no2-19.php
Dwight:," Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.",no2-19.php
Michael:," Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, ""Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me."" A great boss will say, ""Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.""",no2-19.php
Michael:," Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.",no2-19.php
Ryan:, I won't.,no2-19.php
Michael:, Good. Great.,no2-19.php
Ryan:," Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.",no2-19.php
Michael:," No, I think you're gonna stay.",no2-19.php
Michael:," On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.",no2-19.php
Kevin:, Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away],no2-19.php
Dwight:," To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.",no2-19.php
Michael:, [knock on door] Mmm-hmm.,no2-19.php
Ryan:, Hey. I got the information.,no2-19.php
Michael:," Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.",no2-19.php
Ryan:," [turns to camera] ""The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.""",no2-19.php
Michael:," Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.",no2-19.php
Ryan:," [looking at camera] ""There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.""",no2-19.php
Michael:," Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.",no2-19.php
Ryan:," ""For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...""",no2-19.php
Michael:," Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, ""I have cancer.""",no2-19.php
Ryan:," ""The skin is the largest organ of the body.""",no2-19.php
Michael:," Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.",no2-19.php
Angela:," I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.",no2-19.php
Kevin:," So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?",no2-21.php
Pam:, No.,no2-21.php
Kevin:, 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.,no2-21.php
Jim:," Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:, Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.,no2-21.php
Pam:, Yeah?,no2-21.php
Phyllis:," Yeah, pretty stationery.",no2-21.php
Pam:," Oh, thanks!",no2-21.php
Angela:, I didn't get mine yet.,no2-21.php
Pam:, Uh... ,no2-21.php
Pam:," There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",no2-21.php
Michael:," Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:," Uh, on or off?",no2-21.php
I.D. Photographer:, Off.,no2-21.php
Phyllis:, Okay... [removes glasses],no2-21.php
Dwight:, Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,no2-21.php
Phyllis:, [leaving the room] Excuse me.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, Clown paint.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",no2-21.php
Michael:, That's a nice tie.,no2-21.php
Ryan:, Thank you.,no2-21.php
Michael:, That is... who makes that?,no2-21.php
Ryan:," Um, I don't... ",no2-21.php
Michael:, Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,no2-21.php
Ryan:," Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.",no2-21.php
Oscar:," It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed... ",no2-21.php
Michael:, [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?,no2-21.php
Toby:," Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.",no2-21.php
Michael:, What's the problem?,no2-21.php
Oscar:, Angela!,no2-21.php
Toby:, It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.,no2-21.php
Oscar:, Since Christmas.,no2-21.php
Michael:," So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",no2-21.php
Oscar:, No.,no2-21.php
Toby:," Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?",no2-21.php
Michael:, Yes.,no2-21.php
Toby:, Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Yeah?,no2-21.php
Toby:, These things just have a way of working themselves out.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Okay.,no2-21.php
Toby:," It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.",no2-21.php
Michael:, What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... ,no2-21.php
Toby:, Okay.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Okay... what?,no2-21.php
Toby:, That was the right decision for me and my marriage.,no2-21.php
Michael:," Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",no2-21.php
Michael:," [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",no2-21.php
Angela:, Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.,no2-21.php
Michael:," No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",no2-21.php
Oscar:, What's the next one?,no2-21.php
Michael:," Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",no2-21.php
Angela:, Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?,no2-21.php
Michael:," Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",no2-21.php
Michael:," [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using ""I"" emotion language and no judging or ""you"" statements.",no2-21.php
Angela:," I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.",no2-21.php
Michael:," Come on, seriously, that?",no2-21.php
Oscar:," I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the... ",no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",no2-21.php
Pam:, Win!,no2-21.php
Michael:," Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.  ",no2-21.php
Oscar:, No.,no2-21.php
Angela:, That's... no... ,no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",no2-21.php
Angela:," How about, I leave it up?",no2-21.php
Oscar:," How 'bout, she takes it down?",no2-21.php
Pam:," How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",no2-21.php
Pam:, Win.,no2-21.php
Oscar:, Fine.,no2-21.php
Angela:," But, it... ",no2-21.php
Michael:, [claps his hands twice] It is done!,no2-21.php
Pam:, Win,no2-21.php
Photographer:,"  [snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile shot] No, you're all good.",no2-21.php

Pam:," Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.",no2-21.php
Angela:, Oh. Thanks.,no2-21.php
Angela:," It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.",no2-21.php
Toby:, You solved it?,no2-21.php
Michael:, Yes.,no2-21.php
Toby:," Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]",no2-21.php
Michael:, Are those all the other complains?,no2-21.php
Toby:, Mmm-Hm.,no2-21.php
Michael:, I would like to see those please.,no2-21.php
Toby:, I... I can't do that.,no2-21.php
Michael:," You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",no2-21.php
Toby:, That... [shakes head and places hand over the file],no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?",no2-21.php
Toby:, [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.,no2-21.php
Toby:," Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.",no2-21.php
Michael:, Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,no2-21.php
Photographer:," Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]",no2-21.php
Dwight:," Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",no2-21.php
Photographer:, [shoots twice],no2-21.php
Michael:," [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",no2-21.php
Pam:, Nice.,no2-21.php
Michael:, You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,no2-21.php
Toby:," Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]",no2-21.php
Michael:," How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble ""merely listen to and forgotten..."" ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",no2-21.php
Angela:, You already did me.,no2-21.php
Michael:," That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does ""redacted"" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked ""redacted""... ?",no2-21.php
Toby:," Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.",no2-21.php
Michael:," Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",no2-21.php
Pam:, [notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,no2-21.php
Michael:,"  All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",no2-21.php
Pam:," Wait, what did it say?",no2-21.php
Michael:," Uh... [reading]""Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?"" [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right? ",no2-21.php
Pam:, I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?! ,no2-21.php
Michael:," Here is a Kelly complaint: ""Ryan never returns my calls."" Ugh, join the club.",no2-21.php
Ryan:, My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes... ,no2-21.php
Kelly:, I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.,no2-21.php
Toby:, To your HR representative.,no2-21.php
Kelly:," To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.",no2-21.php
Toby:," Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.",no2-21.php
Michael:, [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,no2-21.php
Jim:, Dwight tried to kiss me.,no2-21.php
Michael:, What?!,no2-21.php
Jim:, And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,no2-21.php
Jim:," Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",no2-21.php
Dwight:,"  Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",no2-21.php
Toby:, Sure.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Stanley. [off camera],no2-21.php
Pam:," [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",no2-21.php
Michael:, [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,no2-21.php
Anglea:," I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible]",no2-21.php
Pam:, I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,no2-21.php
Michael:," Someone complained that the men's room is ""whites only"". Stanley, you know that's not true.",no2-21.php
Stanley:, I didn't say that.,no2-21.php
Creed:," Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]",no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:," No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.",no2-21.php
Michael:," And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:," Stanley and I are close, too.",no2-21.php
Stanley:, We sit close.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Oh... ok.,no2-21.php
Toby:," [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]",no2-21.php
Pam:," I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",no2-21.php
Jim:," Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",no2-21.php
Pam:, Don't take her side.,no2-21.php
Jim:," [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",no2-21.php
Pam:, I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,no2-21.php
Jim:, You mean your thoughts and feelings?,no2-21.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no2-21.php
Jim:, Yeah... ,no2-21.php
Phyllis:," I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.",no2-21.php
Angela:," Yes, that's the problem.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:, I guess so... ,no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay, well... all settled, then.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:, [whispering to Angela] I don't like you.,no2-21.php
Michael:," OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",no2-21.php
Creed:, I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.,no2-21.php
Michael:," All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",no2-21.php
Kevin:, I accept your decision!,no2-21.php
Jim:," Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",no2-21.php
Dwight:, That doesn't make any sense.,no2-21.php
Jim:," Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",no2-21.php
Photographer:," [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.",no2-21.php
Dwight:, No.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",no2-21.php
Jim:, This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, This is humongous. I am not a security threat... ,no2-21.php
Jim:, Oh.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",no2-21.php
Jim:, What did I write?,no2-21.php
Dwight:, I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,no2-21.php
Toby:, Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, What box?!,no2-21.php
Phyllis:, But I didn't report your snoring-,no2-21.php
Stanley:," Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]",no2-21.php
Michael:, Uh. Dwight.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",no2-21.php
Michael:, Okay! Calm down.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,no2-21.php
Michael:," Hey, hey!",no2-21.php
Dwight:, Him or me?,no2-21.php
Michael:, Stop.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Okay... ,no2-21.php
Dwight:," Either he goes, or I go.",no2-21.php
Michael:, Dwight... ,no2-21.php
Dwight:, You choose!,no2-21.php
Michael:, Stop... ,no2-21.php
Dwight:, One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],no2-21.php
Michael:, Oh... kay... ,no2-21.php
Dwight:, I am not bluffing!,no2-21.php
Michael:, Okay.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, Okay?,no2-21.php
Michael:, Yes.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",no2-21.php
Michael:, Mm-hmm.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, I deserve this. You know I do!,no2-21.php
Michael:, [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,no2-21.php
Dwight:, You have till five.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",no2-21.php
Michael:," Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] ""Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert."" [flips to another paper] ""Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.""",no2-21.php
Jim:, [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,no2-21.php
Michael:," [reading] ""This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer."" [flips to another paper] ""Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.""  Gah. ""This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.""",no2-21.php
Jim:," That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",no2-21.php
Michael:," [reading] ""Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.""",no2-21.php
Jim:," Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",no2-21.php
Michael:," ""By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.""",no2-21.php
Jim:," Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.",no2-21.php
Michael:," The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",no2-21.php
Jim:, Maybe Stanford would be cool.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, It's a good market. Higher volume.,no2-21.php
Jim:, Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, I have a girlfriend... ,no2-21.php
Jim:," Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.",no2-21.php
Michael:," Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",no2-21.php
Michael:," Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",no2-21.php
Dwight:, I want an answer by tomorrow.,no2-21.php
Michael:," Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",no2-21.php
Dwight:, Fine.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Good. Okay.,no2-21.php
Michael:, Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,no2-21.php
Photographer:, I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.,no2-21.php
Michael:," Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",no2-21.php
Photographer:, You mean digital?,no2-21.php
Michael:, It'll take like two seconds.,no2-21.php
Photographer:, 20 bucks.,no2-21.php
Michael:," Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.    ",no2-21.php
Stanley:, You gotta be kiddin' me.,no2-21.php
Michael:," Come on, everybody.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.",no2-21.php
Photographer:," One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.",no2-21.php
Michael:," We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",no2-21.php
Photographer:," Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three...  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]",no2-21.php
Michael:," Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",no2-21.php
Photographer:, That'll be another 20.,no2-21.php
Michael:, What?,no2-21.php
Pam:," Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",no2-21.php
Michael:, [off camera] You just press the button.,no2-21.php
Angela:, What?,no2-21.php
Jim:," No, Pam.",no2-21.php
Pam:, [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.,no2-21.php
Jim:," Pam, it wasn't her.",no2-21.php
Pam:, What?!,no2-21.php
Jim:, I'm the one who complained about you.,no2-21.php
Jim:, I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,no2-21.php
Michael:," [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.",no2-21.php
Jim:," You know, it was one day.",no2-21.php
Michael:, [off camera] That's terrible.,no2-21.php
Jim:, And I took it right back. It was like... ,no2-21.php
Pam:, Okay.,no2-21.php
Phyllis:," Oh, dear.",no2-21.php
Michael:," [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]",no2-21.php
Michael:,  It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,no2-21.php
Michael:," [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?",no2-21.php
Michael:," But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",no2-21.php
Jim:," [on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]",no2-21.php
Female worker:," Okay, Jan will see you now.",no2-21.php
Jim:," Oh, thanks.",no2-21.php
Michael:, And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, [elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?,no2-21.php
Jim:, I don't know.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?",no2-21.php
Jim:," Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.",no2-21.php
Jim:, Probably is.,no2-21.php
Dwight:," Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.",no2-21.php
Pam:," [telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]",no2-21.php
Jim:," Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.",no2-21.php
Dwight:, This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.,no2-21.php
Jim:," That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," No, there's no blood.",no2-21.php
Jim:, Maybe poison?,no2-21.php
Dwight:, Possibly.,no2-21.php
Jim:, My God!,no2-21.php
Dwight:," [exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?",no2-21.php
Michael:, Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.,no2-21.php
Ryan:, I know.,no2-21.php
Michael:," On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.",no2-21.php
Photographer:," [Dwight slurping] Okay, here we go. One, two...",no2-21.php
Dwight:," He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.",no2-21.php
Michael:," I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, ""What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?"" Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.",no2-21.php
Dwight:, I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.,no2-21.php
Photographer:, So there were no death threats?,no2-21.php
Dwight:, Let me see your ID.,no2-21.php
Michael:," There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, ""I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu."" See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.",no2-21.php
Michael:," There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.",no2-21.php
Photographer:, All right.,no2-21.php
Pam:," That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?",no2-21.php
Photographer:, Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?,no2-21.php
Jim:, Not bad.,no2-21.php
Dwight:, I gave her a higher clearance than you.,no2-21.php
Jim:, What does Level Red mean?,no2-21.php
Dwight:," I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]",no2-21.php
Meredith:, Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed],no2-21.php
Kevin:," No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.",no2-21.php
Phyllis:," You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]",no2-21.php
Michael:, Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.,no2-21.php
Phyllis:," Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.",no2-21.php
Dwight:, I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.,no2-21.php
Phyllis:," You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.",no2-21.php
Michael:," ""Cage Match""? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.",no2-21.php
Hank the Security Guard:," Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?",no2-21.php
Dwight:," Yes, sir.",no2-21.php
Kevin:, Morning.,no2-21.php
Hank the Security Guard:," Good morning. Okay, go ahead.",no2-21.php
Dwight:," Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!",no2-21.php
Michael:," Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, ""Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening."" Makes you feel good.",no2-22.php
Jim:, Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,no2-22.php
Dwight:," I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",no2-22.php
Pam:, It's a nice tux.,no2-22.php
Dwight:," I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",no2-22.php
Roy:," So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.",no2-22.php
Pam:," Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",no2-22.php
Dwight:," Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",no2-22.php
Jim:, I can always kind of win at roulette.,no2-22.php
Dwight:," Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",no2-22.php
Jim:, Yeah.,no2-22.php
Dwight:, How would you do that?,no2-22.php
Jim:, Mind control.,no2-22.php
Dwight:, [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,no2-22.php
Jim:," Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",no2-22.php
Dwight:, I don't believe you. Continue.,no2-22.php
Jim:," It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",no2-22.php
Dwight:," [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",no2-22.php
Jim:," Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]",no2-22.php
Dwight:," Oh, my God.",no2-22.php
Michael:, I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,no2-22.php
Jan:," [on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",no2-22.php
Michael:, Top 80 percent!,no2-22.php
Jan:, Michael?,no2-22.php
Michael:, Yeah?,no2-22.php
Jan:, You know that I'm very serious here.,no2-22.php
Michael:," Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",no2-22.php
Jan:, What?,no2-22.php
Michael:," Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. ",no2-22.php
Jan:, I thought that you were their fearless leader.,no2-22.php
Michael:," I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",no2-22.php
Jan:, [laughs] I think you can handle it. ,no2-22.php
Michael:," Oh, come on. Come on.",no2-22.php
Jan:," I think so, Michael...",no2-22.php
Michael:," You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",no2-22.php
Jan:," Goodbye, Michael.",no2-22.php
Michael:," Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. ",no2-22.php
Michael:," Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",no2-22.php
Oscar:, Again? We do that every year.,no2-22.php
Michael:," Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",no2-22.php
Oscar:, It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,no2-22.php
Michael:," Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",no2-22.php
Dwight:, Yes!,no2-22.php
Michael:," So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",no2-22.php
Jim:, That doesn't exist anymore. ,no2-22.php
Michael:," Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",no2-22.php
Pam:," No, they stopped making that show.",no2-22.php
Michael:," Well, then, they need our money more than ever. ",no2-22.php
Angela:," You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.",no2-22.php
Creed:, There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them. ,no2-22.php
Kevin:, Something with animals. Or people.,no2-22.php
Kelly:, hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it.,no2-22.php
Angela:," We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?",no2-22.php
Michael:," Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...",no2-22.php
Toby:," Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?",no2-22.php
Michael:," Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. ",no2-22.php
Jim:, I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. ,no2-22.php
Michael:," No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS. ",no2-22.php
Phyllis:, Afghani.,no2-22.php
Michael:, What?,no2-22.php
Phyllis:, Afghani. ,no2-22.php
Michael:, That's a dog. ,no2-22.php

Michael:, That's a shawl. ,no2-22.php
Dwight:," Wait, canine AIDS?",no2-22.php
Michael:, No. Humans with AIDS.,no2-22.php
Creed:, Who has AIDS?,no2-22.php
Jim:," Guys, the Afghanistananies.",no2-22.php
Michael:," Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. ",no2-22.php
Michael:," There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. ""I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head."" [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams. ",no2-22.php
Jim:, What are you doing?,no2-22.php
Pam:," Oh, nothing. ",no2-22.php
Jim:," ""Till Death Do Us Rock.""",no2-22.php

Meredith's Vet:, And we had sex in the parking lot.,no2-22.php
Kelly:, Here you go.,no3-06.php
Michael:," Nice dress, Ryan.",no3-06.php
Kelly:, It's not a dress. It's a kurta.,no3-06.php
Michael:, [laughing] OK.,no3-06.php
Michael:," Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.",no3-06.php
Kelly:, You look so handsome.,no3-06.php
Pam:, Really you do. I love the material.,no3-06.php
Kelly:, I know.,no3-06.php
Michael:, How come you didn't get me one?,no3-06.php
Kelly:, I... ,no3-06.php
Phyllis:," Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people. ",no3-06.php
Pam:, I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired. ,no3-06.php
Meredith:, Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?,no3-06.php
Pam:," Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.",no3-06.php
Kelly:," I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.",no3-06.php
Pam:," I just feel kind of tired, you know.",no3-06.php
Dwight:, Maybe you've got mono.,no3-06.php
Pam:, Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.,no3-06.php

Kevin:, Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?,no3-06.php
Roy:," I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?",no3-06.php
Kevin:," Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?",no3-06.php
Angela:, Don't go. They eat monkey brains.,no3-06.php
Michael:, Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. ,no3-06.php
Michael:," It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby. ",no3-06.php
Stanley:, I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.,no3-06.php
Michael:, Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.,no3-06.php
Michael:," I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol. ",no3-06.php
Michael:," Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on. ",no3-06.php
Kelly:," Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...",no3-06.php
Michael:, Kelly?,no3-06.php
Kelly:, Sparkles... ,no3-06.php
Michael:, Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.,no3-06.php
Kelly:," Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.",no3-06.php
Angela:, How many gods do you have?,no3-06.php
Kelly:," Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.",no3-06.php
Angela:, [points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story?,no3-06.php
Kevin:, She looks like Pam from the neck down. ,no3-06.php
Dwight:," Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil... ",no3-06.php
Michael:," All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.",no3-06.php
Jim:, Sorry.,no3-06.php
Jim:," I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. ",no3-06.php
Karen:, Nice basket.,no3-06.php
Jim:, Thank you.,no3-06.php
Michael:," Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan.

Dwight:, I see dead people. ,no3-06.php
Michael:, Okay. Spoiler... alert. ,no3-06.php
Dwight:, He was dead the whole time.,no3-06.php

Tony:," Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms. ",no3-06.php
Karen:, Oh. Did you shake it?,no3-06.php
Tony:," Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.",no3-06.php
Andy:," We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.",no3-06.php
Jim:, 'Scuse me?,no3-06.php
Andy:, Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.  ,no3-06.php
Jim:, Wow.,no3-06.php
Andy:, From 'Cheers'.,no3-06.php
Jim:, Yup. ,no3-06.php
Michael:, And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before? ,no3-06.php
Creed:, I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'. ,no3-06.php
Meredith:," Oh, that's what they call it.",no3-06.php
Kevin:, This is the best meeting we've ever had.,no3-06.php
Michael:," Thank you, Kevin.",no3-06.php
Angela:, I find this incredibly offensive. ,no3-06.php
Michael:," Well, I find it beautiful.",no3-06.php
Angela:," Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.",no3-06.php
Michael:, No... ,no3-06.php
Toby:," Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.",no3-06.php
Michael:," No, You're not going to collect them.",no3-06.php
Toby:, Yes.,no3-06.php
Michael:," No. This is delightful, charming culture.",no3-06.php
Michael:, My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight. ,no3-06.php
Josh:," All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. ",no3-06.php
Karen:, Thanks.,no3-06.php
Josh:, And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time. ,no3-06.php
Karen:, Got it. ,no3-06.php
Jim:," Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.",no3-06.php
Andy:, You guys ready to party? ,no3-06.php
Jim:, What's that? ,no3-06.php
Andy:, I said are you ready TO PARTY!,no3-06.php
Phyllis:, Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?,no3-06.php
Angela:, I wish some of us still had our shoes on.,no3-06.php
Kevin:, Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you. ,no3-06.php
Carol:, [wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party!,no3-06.php
Michael:, [points at woman] What does that look like to you?,no3-06.php
Carol:, An Indian woman in a sari.,no3-06.php

Kevin:, Nice outfit.,no3-06.php
Michael:," Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.",no3-06.php
Michael:," I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions... ",no3-06.php

Server:, It's all vegetarian.,no3-06.php
Angela:, I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.,no3-06.php
Michael:," Oh, yuck. [spits out food] ",no3-06.php
Carol:, What? Too spicy?,no3-06.php
Michael:, No. These s'mores are disgusting.,no3-06.php
Carol:, They're not s'mores. They're samosas.,no3-06.php
Michael:, Do you think they have any s'mores?,no3-06.php

Dwight:, Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut! ,no3-06.php
Kelly:, I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!,no3-06.php

Michael:, Well...,no3-07.php
Jan:, It's... it's about talent.,no3-07.php
Michael:," Oh, you gotta be... Josh?",no3-07.php
Jan:, Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.,no3-07.php
Michael:," Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?",no3-07.php
Michael:," It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.",no3-07.php
Michael:, Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Hey stranger.,no3-07.php
Michael:, Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.,no3-07.php
Michael:," Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.",no3-07.php
Dwight :," When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, ""Something Weird is Going On."" Colon, ""What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute."" ",no3-07.php
Karen:," Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]",no3-07.php
Jim:, Really? Wow... that's bad.,no3-07.php
Andy:," Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!",no3-07.php
Jim:," Well, I work here now.",no3-07.php
Andy:, Mmmm.. suck-ah!,no3-07.php
Pam:, Are you okay?,no3-07.php
Michael:," Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.",no3-07.php
Pam:, What did Jan want?,no3-07.php
Michael:," Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...",no3-07.php
Pam:, What can't you tell me?,no3-07.php
Michael:," Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.",no3-07.php
Pam:, What?!,no3-07.php
Michael:, What?,no3-07.php
Pam:, You just said that we're gonna be gone...?,no3-07.php
Michael:, Do I have any messages?,no3-07.php
Pam:," Michael, what's going on?",no3-07.php
Michael:," Ok, ok...",no3-07.php
Michael:," [facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.",no3-07.php
Toby:," Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.",no3-07.php
Michael:," You knew about this all along, didn't you?",no3-07.php
Toby:, Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.,no3-07.php
Michael:, Traitor. You are a traitor.,no3-07.php
Angela:," What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?",no3-07.php
Michael:, I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.,no3-07.php
Ryan:, It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.,no3-07.php
Angela:, I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.,no3-07.php
Kelly:," If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.",no3-07.php
Andy:," [surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!",no3-07.php
Jim:," I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",no3-07.php
Stanley:, I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier.,no3-07.php
Pam:," It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, ""Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."" So, maybe that'll stop now.",no3-07.php
Roy:, What does that mean?,no3-07.php
Kevin:," Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.",no3-07.php
Roy:," I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, ""You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)""? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.",no3-07.php
Darryl:, Hey Mike.,no3-07.php
Michael:, Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs],no3-07.php
Darryl:," Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.",no3-07.php
Michael:," I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.",no3-07.php
Darryl:, I wasn't.,no3-07.php
Michael:," So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...",no3-07.php
Darryl:," Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.",no3-07.php
Michael:, Awesome.,no3-07.php
Michael:, This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.,no3-07.php
Michael:," All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go.",no3-07.php
Dwight:, Yes!,no3-07.php
Pam:," Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.",no3-07.php
Michael:, Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.,no3-07.php
Dwight:, What's the plan?,no3-07.php
Michael:," Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.",no3-07.php
Dwight:, Can I drive?,no3-07.php
Michael:, No... way.,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Shotgun!,no3-07.php
Michael:, No. There's no one else.,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Still.,no3-07.php
Dwight:," Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.",no3-07.php
Michael:," Okay, okay. Um...",no3-07.php
Dwight:," But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.",no3-07.php
Michael:, Why?,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Christmas card list.,no3-07.php
Michael:, You sent him cards? You never met him.,no3-07.php
Dwight:," But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.",no3-07.php
Jim:," Hey, do you have a second?",no3-07.php
Josh:," Sure, what's up?",no3-07.php
Jim:," I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",no3-07.php
Josh:, I honestly don't. I don't know.,no3-07.php
Jim:," Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?",no3-07.php
Josh:," You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.",no3-07.php
Jim:, What does that mean?,no3-07.php
Jan:, Hi.,no3-07.php
Josh:," Jan, hey.",no3-07.php
Jan:," Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?",no3-07.php
Ryan:," [to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.",no3-07.php
Ryan:," This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.",no3-07.php
Michael:," Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like ""Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person."" It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.",no3-07.php
Jan:," So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.",no3-07.php
Josh:," Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.",no3-07.php
Jan:, Awesome.,no3-07.php
Josh:," Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.",no3-07.php
Jan:, Wha... excuse... why not?,no3-07.php
Josh:," As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.",no3-07.php
Jan:, Today?,no3-07.php
Josh:, [nods],no3-07.php
Jan:, You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?,no3-07.php
Josh:, [sighs],no3-07.php
Jan:," Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...",no3-07.php
Josh:," I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.",no3-07.php
Jan:, I'm gonna make some calls.,no3-07.php
Jim:," Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.",no3-07.php
Dwight:," So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?",no3-07.php
Michael:, I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,no3-07.php
Dwight:," No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.",no3-07.php
Michael:, All right.,no3-07.php
Dwight:," [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.",no3-07.php
M ichael:," Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?",no3-07.php
Dwight:, Yes? What is the meaning of this?,no3-07.php
Michael :, Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,no3-07.php
Dwight:," Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.",no3-07.php
Michael:," Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",no3-07.php
Dwight:," Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.",no3-07.php
Michael:," [no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.",no3-07.php
Dwight:," [as himself] Whoa hey, why not?",no3-07.php
Michael:," Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?",no3-07.php
Dwight:, Okay.,no3-07.php
Michael:, Don't touch me this time.,no3-07.php
Dwight:," [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...",no3-07.php
Michael:," Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?",no3-07.php
Dwight:, [frightened] Uh!,no3-07.php
Jan:," So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.",no3-07.php
Jim:, Wow.,no3-07.php
Jan:," And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.",no3-07.php
Jim:, Thank you.,no3-07.php
Jan:, Yeah.,no3-07.php
Jim:," No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...",no3-07.php
Jan:, Michael.,no3-07.php
Jim:," No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.",no3-07.php
Jan:," Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.",no3-07.php
Jim:, Okay.,no3-07.php
Phyllis:," Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.",no3-07.php
Kevin:, Where are we going?,no3-07.php
Phyllis:, I thought maybe DJ's.,no3-07.php
Kevin:, How about Cugino's?,no3-07.php
Angela:, I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.,no3-07.php
Kevin:, How 'bout Cooper's then?,no3-07.php
Angela:, No seafood.,no3-07.php
Kevin:," But, I don't want to go to DJ's.",no3-07.php
Angela:," Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?",no3-07.php
Phyllis:," Okay, forget it. [walks away]",no3-07.php
Kevin:, Hooters?,no3-07.php
Angela:, No.,no3-07.php
Dwight:," Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.",no3-07.php
Michael:, [takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie],no3-07.php
Jan:, [in Scranton] Where's Michael?,no3-07.php
Pam:, He's not here. I don't know where he is.,no3-07.php
Jan:," [looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here?",no3-07.php
Phyllis:, We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.,no3-07.php
Jan:," Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.",no3-07.php
Angela:, Yes!,no3-07.php
Kevin:, Yes! [hugs Angela],no3-07.php
Phyllis:, Stanley! [hugs Stanley],no3-07.php
Pam:, Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?,no3-07.php
Jan:," Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.",no3-07.php
Pam:," Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?",no3-07.php
Jan:, Back?,no3-07.php
Pam:, Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?,no3-07.php
Jan:," Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.",no3-07.php
Dwight:, [referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?,no3-07.php
Michael:, The office.,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Gonna get it?,no3-07.php
Michael:," No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.",no3-07.php
Pam:, I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,no3-07.php
Ryan:, Is Jim coming back.,no3-07.php
Pam:," That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.",no3-07.php
Ryan:," I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.",no3-07.php
Pam:," Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?",no3-07.php
Ryan:," Oh, yeah, totally.",no3-07.php
Kelly:," Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!",no3-07.php
Karen:, What you gonna do?,no3-07.php
Jim:, I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?,no3-07.php
Karen:," You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.",no3-07.php
Jim:, You'd actually move to Scranton?,no3-07.php
Karen:," Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.",no3-07.php
Jim:, New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?,no3-07.php
Karen:," Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.",no3-07.php
Josh:, Hey Andy!,no3-07.php
Andy:," [after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?",no3-07.php
Josh:, I just want to say thanks. Good luck.,no3-07.php
Andy:," Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.",no3-07.php
Michael:, Anything?,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Nothing. [puts down binoculars],no3-07.php
Michael:, What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?,no3-07.php
Dwight:, Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,no3-07.php
Michael:," [pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.",no3-07.php
Dwight:, My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.,no3-07.php
Michael:, That was hilarious. The foam ...,no3-07.php
Dwight:," Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.",no3-07.php
Michael:," Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.",no3-07.php
Dwight:, What were your favorite moments?,no3-07.php
Michael:," Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. ",no3-07.php
Dwight:, What about when Jan said the branch was closing?,no3-07.php
Michael:," God, Dwight!",no3-07.php
Dwight:," Well, it doesn't...",no3-07.php
Kevin:," Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.",no3-07.php
Pam:," No thanks, guys.",no3-07.php
Kevin:, All right.,no3-07.php
Pam:, Have fun though.,no3-07.php

Ryan:," Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.",no3-07.php
Kevin:," Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.",no3-07.php
Phyllis:, [to Pam] I'll tell you later.,no3-07.php
Pam:, Okay.,no3-07.php
Roy:," Crazy day, huh?",no3-07.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no3-07.php
Roy:," Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.",no3-07.php
Pam:," Yeah, me too.",no3-07.php
Pam:," Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",no3-07.php
Jim:," Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",no3-07.php
Karen:," Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.",no3-07.php
Jim:, Okay.,no3-07.php

Dwight:, [picks up his beeping cell phone],no3-07.php

Jim:, Hey.,no3-09.php
Karen:, ...Almost done?,no3-09.php
Jim:, Just about... yup. Now. ,no3-09.php
Jim:," Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.",no3-09.php
Michael:," Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.",no3-09.php
Angela:," Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.",no3-09.php
Jan:, [over phone] Mmhmm.,no3-09.php
Angela:," Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. ",no3-09.php
Jan:, We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.,no3-09.php

Kevin:, Hmm. Martin? ,no3-09.php
Michael:, Kuhhhh... you are such a racist. ,no3-09.php

Kevin:, He is black... right? And... ,no3-09.php
Michael:, Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.,no3-09.php
Jan:, ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.,no3-09.php
Kevin:, Yeah!,no3-09.php
Jan:, Michael?,no3-09.php
Michael:, Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.,no3-09.php
Kevin:, I wonder what he did. ,no3-09.php
Michael:," In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",no3-09.php
Pam:, Why would anyone go to jail for that?,no3-09.php
Michael:," Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",no3-09.php
Kevin:, Cool.,no3-09.php
Pam:, Okay. Angela?,no3-09.php
Angela:," Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.",no3-09.php
Michael:, Good. All right. [everyone leaves],no3-09.php
Jim:, [picks up phone] Jim Halpert.,no3-09.php
Andy:, [over phone] I am so horny.,no3-09.php

Andy:," All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?",no3-09.php

Martin:," Good. Getting settled, you know?",no3-09.php
Michael:," Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person.

Martin:, So... you all wanna know what I was in for?,no3-09.php
Michael:, No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them. ,no3-09.php
Martin:," Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. ",no3-09.php
Michael:, [laughs] That is awesome.,no3-09.php
Kevin:," I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.",no3-09.php
Pam:, What was prison like?,no3-09.php
Martin:, Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.,no3-09.php
Kevin:, You got outdoors time?,no3-09.php
Martin:," Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games... ",no3-09.php

Kevin:, I would so rather be in prison. ,no3-09.php
Ryan:, Prison sounds great.,no3-09.php

Andy:," Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.

Andy:, Yeah.,no3-09.php
Jim:, Quick question - do you play the guitar?,no3-09.php
Andy:, I play the banjo.,no3-09.php

Michael:," All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say ""Boo"" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike!

Angela:, Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?,no3-09.php
Michael:," Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink.

Michael:, Internet. ,no3-09.php
Jim:," So, not prison.",no3-09.php
Michael:," And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. ",no3-09.php
Jim:," What'd you do, Prison Mike?",no3-09.php
Michael:, I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.,no3-09.php

Dwight:, Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?,no3-09.php
Angela:," Don't encourage him, Dwight. ",no3-09.php
Michael:," The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",no3-09.php
Karen:, Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?,no3-09.php
Michael:," No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you.

Pam:," Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.",no3-09.php
Martin:," Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison. ",no3-09.php

Jim:," Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. ",no3-09.php

Toby:, [answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? ,no3-09.php
Toby:, Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?,no3-09.php
Michael:," They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",no3-09.php
Toby:," Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.",no3-09.php
Michael:," Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",no3-09.php
Toby:," You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.",no3-09.php
Michael:," [unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",no3-09.php
Michael:," Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. ",no3-09.php

Toby:," Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.",no3-10.php
Dwight:," No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. ",no3-10.php
Dwight:," Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed. ",no3-10.php
Dwight:," He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. ",no3-10.php
Jim:, Wow. Win-Win.,no3-10.php
Dwight:," Exactly. Thank you, Jim.",no3-10.php
Phyllis:, I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?,no3-10.php

Michael:, And next to your kids. What?,no3-10.php
Carol:, This is so weird. ,no3-10.php
Michael:, I don't understand?,no3-10.php

Pam:, I know. ,no3-10.php
Michael:, It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.,no3-10.php

Michael:, [moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?,no3-10.php
Pam:, Like what? ,no3-10.php
Michael:," Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",no3-10.php
Pam:," Well.. um I, I don't... ",no3-10.php
Michael:, And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?,no3-10.php

Michael:," Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40.

Kevin:," But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.",no3-11.php
Michael:," His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off.

Michael:, You are.  You are.,no3-14.php
Michael:," So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.",no3-14.php

Michael:," Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride.

Angela:, Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!,no3-15.php

Michael:, [in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!,no3-15.php
Michael:, Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.,no3-15.php
Dwight:, Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?,no3-15.php
Jim:, You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.,no3-15.php

Dwight:, Of course I saw it.,no3-15.php

Pam:," Michael, do something! ",no3-22.php
Dwight:," Aggggh, that stings! ",no3-22.php
Michael:," Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. ""Outside Hire.""",no3-22.php
Angela:," Or Mrs. ""Outside Hire.""",no3-22.php
Michael:," Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round.

Michael:, Who's Amanda Bynes?,no3-22.php
Kelly:," She's from ""What a Girl Wants.""",no3-22.php
Michael:," Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. ",no3-22.php
Jim:," Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. ",no3-22.php
Michael:, You are being too modest. ,no3-22.php
Jim:," Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. ",no3-22.php
Michael:," Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. ",no3-22.php
Dwight:," The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, ""Describe your act.""

Michael:," That is a very, very funny story. ",no3-22.php
Pam:," [runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle.

Angela:, How can she make you get back together with her? ,no3-23.php
Michael:, She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do. ,no3-23.php
Pam:, This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. ,no3-23.php
Michael:, I wasn't. ,no3-23.php
Pam:, You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. ,no3-23.php

Jim:, Unbelievable.,no3-23.php
Karen:, Wow!,no3-23.php
Jim:, She could put the cup right there.,no3-23.php
Karen:, I know!,no3-23.php
Pam:,.,no3-23.php
Meredith:," I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.",no3-23.php
Kevin:," I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.",no3-23.php
Creed:," I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.",no3-23.php
Jan:, So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.,no3-23.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no3-23.php
Jan:," I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.",no3-23.php
Michael:, First got priorities.,no3-23.php
Jan:, And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...,no3-23.php
Michael:, Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs],no3-23.php
Michael:," because of the boob job.  Excuse me, boob enhancement.  That would be shallow.  And this is the opposite of shallow.  This is... emotionally magnificent.",no3-23.php

Pam:, [to Jim] Good luck.,no3-23.php
Jim:, Thanks.,no3-23.php
Pam:," I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.",no3-23.php
Dwight:, I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?,no3-23.php
Andy:," White, because it contains all other colors.",no3-23.php
Dwight:, Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?,no3-23.php
Andy:," You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.",no3-23.php
Dwight:, What is the capital of Maine?,no3-23.php
Andy:," The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.",no3-23.php
Dwight:," Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.",no3-23.php
Andy:, Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. ,no3-23.php
Dwight:," You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. ",no3-23.php
Andy:," I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?  ",no3-23.php
Andy:," I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous. ",no3-23.php
Dwight:," [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed. ",no3-23.php
Andy:, Damn it! ,no3-23.php

Michael:," So, I guess we're getting back together. ",no3-23.php
Pam:, What happened? ,no3-23.php
Michael:," Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. ",no3-23.php
Michael:," Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.",no3-23.php
Karen:, So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first? ,no3-23.php
Jim:," Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?",no3-23.php
Karen:, How often do you come here? ,no3-23.php

Karen:," I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim. ",no3-23.php
Michael:," Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch.

Dwight:, [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work? ,no3-23.php
Jim:," [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. ",no3-23.php
Karen:," That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]",no3-23.php
Karen:, So what's going to happen to us when I get this job? ,no3-23.php
Jim:, Oh do you mean when I get the job? ,no3-23.php
Karen:, you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me?  I'm not stupid. I was at the beach.  We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. ,no3-23.php
Jim:, You mean Kevin?,no3-23.php
Karen:," Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there. ",no3-23.php
Jim:," Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]",no3-23.php

Karen:," Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.",no3-23.php

Jim:, I'm gonna introduce myself.,no3-23.php
Michael:," No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...",no3-23.php
Michael:," I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.",no3-23.php
Dwight:, Michael is gone.,no3-23.php
Andy:, Hail to the chief!,no3-23.php
Dwight:, My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.,no3-23.php
Andy:, My first order of business: accept.,no3-23.php
Dwight:, As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug],no3-23.php
Andy:," Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]",no3-23.php

Hunter:, Okay.,no3-23.php
Michael:," Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the ""motorboat"" noise] ""Brbrbrbrbr!"" also?",no3-23.php
Dwight:, You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.,no3-23.php
Pam:, Thank you.,no3-23.php
Dwight:," I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.",no3-23.php
Pam:, Really?,no3-23.php
Dwight:," Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.",no3-23.php
Pam:, You will be your own assistant.,no3-23.php
Dwight:," Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.",no3-23.php
Pam:, the Assistant Regional Manager.  Andy is your number two.  I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager.,no3-23.php
Dwight:, the Regional Manager.,no3-23.php
Pam:, Mm-hmm.,no3-23.php
Dwight:, Do you accept?,no3-23.php

Michael:, Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,no3-23.php
David:," Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?",no3-23.php
Michael:, Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.,no3-23.php
David:, Okay.  And your strengths?,no3-23.php
Michael:," Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.",no3-23.php
David:,  Oh.  Yes.  Very good.,no3-23.php

Phyllis:, I think it's gonna be Michael.,no3-23.php
Oscar:, Do you really think he's qualified for that job?,no3-23.php
Phyllis:," No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.",no3-23.php
Oscar:, [laughs] Mm.  Yeah.,no3-23.php
Dwight:," Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.  ",no3-23.php
Pam:, [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?,no3-23.php
Dwight:," Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.",no3-23.php
Oscar:, of your dollars is worth one real dollar?,no3-23.php
Dwight:, Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!,no3-23.php
Stanley:, Amen.,no3-23.php

David:, What do you think we could be doing better?,no3-23.php
Michael:," I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, ""Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!""

Jan:, Erratic?,no3-23.php
David:," Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.

Angela:, I would prefer a public place. See you after work.,no4-02.php
Jan:," Hi, Pam.",no4-02.php

Ryan:," Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.",no4-02.php
Jan:," Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry.",no4-02.php
Ryan:, Well... you look great.,no4-02.php
Jan:," Thank you, thank you.",no4-02.php
Ryan:, Scranton suits you.,no4-02.php
Jan:, Best decision I ever made.,no4-02.php
Ryan:, You were let go.,no4-02.php
Jan:, You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael's office],no4-02.php
Michael:, Hey.,no4-02.php
Jan:, Hey.,no4-02.php
Michael:," [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",no4-02.php
Jan:, What?,no4-02.php
Michael:, I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,no4-02.php
Jan:," So, what's Ryan doing here?",no4-02.php
Michael:," Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",no4-02.php
Jan:, He's such a snake.,no4-02.php
Michael:, Well...,no4-02.php
Jan:, I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.,no4-02.php
Michael:, What is that... word?,no4-02.php
Jan:," Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.",no4-02.php
Michael:, So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,no4-02.php
Jan:," Yes, Michael, they do.",no4-02.php
Oscar:, Creed?,no4-02.php
Creed:," Yes, sir.",no4-02.php

Ryan:, Michael.,no4-02.php
Michael:, Have a seat.,no4-02.php
Ryan:, We're not doing this today.,no4-02.php
Michael:, Have a seat. Like everybody else.,no4-02.php
Ryan:, OK. This is...,no4-02.php
Michael:," Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",no4-02.php
Toby:," Technically, he's right.",no4-02.php
Michael:," Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",no4-02.php
Creed:, Because they're lame.,no4-02.php
Michael:," No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like ""where's the Beef?"" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.",no4-02.php
Jim:," Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",no4-02.php
Pam:," Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.",no4-02.php
Michael:," I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",no4-02.php
Pam:, Oh. [man enters conference room],no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:, Michael Scott?,no4-02.php
Michael:," [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]",no4-02.php
Dwight:," Oh, yeah. Yes!",no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:, Thank you everyone.,no4-02.php
Ryan:," Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?",no4-02.php
Michael:, Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door],no4-02.php
Ryan:, We have actual work to do.,no4-02.php
Michael:, Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other],no4-02.php
Michael:," Bob, how old are you?",no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:, I'm 87.,no4-02.php
Michael:," Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:," Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.",no4-02.php
Michael:," Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",no4-02.php
Dwight:," I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.",no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:, I started this company in 1949.,no4-02.php
Michael:, Wow.,no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:," Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.",no4-02.php
Michael:," Oh, boy.",no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:," And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.",no4-02.php
Michael:, Great.,no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:," And he was, he was [starts laughing] at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.",no4-02.php
Michael:, Great.  ,no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:, And...,no4-02.php
Michael:, That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:," Well I, I, I came here in a cab.",no4-02.php
Michael:, Perfect. [starts closing the door],no4-02.php
Robert Dunder:," Well, cou, could you get me another... [Michael closes door]",no4-02.php
Michael:," Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",no4-02.php
Pam:, I think that I should help him get home.,no4-02.php
Michael:," No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.",no4-02.php
Michael:, Good night guys. [staff leaves the office],no4-02.php
Ryan:," Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.",no4-02.php
Michael:," I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",no4-02.php
Ryan:," Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.",no4-02.php
Michael:, I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,no4-02.php
Ryan:, Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?,no4-02.php
Kelly:," You know, some place romantic and expensive.",no4-02.php
Ryan:," Kelly, come on.",no4-02.php
Kelly:," You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]",no4-02.php
Dwight:, Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,no4-02.php
Angela:, Very much. How's your meat?,no4-02.php
Dwight:, Dry. Delicious.,no4-02.php
Angela:, I heard a joke today.,no4-02.php
Dwight:," Oh, that's funny.",no4-02.php
Angela:," Yes, it was.",no4-02.php
Dwight:, Are you enjoying your mineral water?,no4-02.php
Angela:, I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.,no4-02.php
Dwight:," Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.",no4-02.php

Toby:, I just really like you.,no4-02.php
Amy:, Okay.  Bye guys.  Nice to meet you.,no4-02.php
Toby:, Have a great day!,no4-02.php
Pam:," Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.",no4-02.php
Toby:, I wouldn't want to do that now would I?,no4-02.php
Michael:, Smell that. Do you smell that? ,no4-02.php
Dwight:, Dry rot?,no4-02.php
Michael:," No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.",no4-02.php
Andy:," Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.",no4-02.php
Michael:," Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.",no4-02.php
Michael:," Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.",no4-02.php

Ryan:, You don't?,no4-02.php
Kelly:, No!,no4-02.php
Ryan:, You lied about being pregnant.,no4-02.php
Kelly:," Right, so?",no4-02.php

Jim:, Hey.,no4-02.php

Michael:," Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.",no4-02.php
Ryan:," What's, uh, going on here?",no4-02.php
Michael:," I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.",no4-02.php
Ryan:, With gift baskets.,no4-02.php
Michael:," With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.",no4-02.php
Michael:," Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. ""You can't be on the team"", ""You can't move on to second grade"". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.",no4-02.php
Michael:," OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.",no4-02.php

Phyllis:, This is stupid.,no4-02.php
Michael:," OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.",no4-02.php
Phyllis:, How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?,no4-02.php
Michael:," Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.",no4-02.php
Andy:," What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.",no4-02.php
Jim:, What about a gift basket full of cash?,no4-02.php

Michael:," But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.",no4-02.php
Dwight:, Thank you.,no4-02.php

Creed:," [looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.",no4-02.php
Dwight:," [in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",no4-02.php

Jim:," Yeah, he's definitely something.",no4-02.php
Kevin:, What does that mean?,no4-02.php
Jim:," That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?",no4-02.php
Andy:, Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.,no4-02.php
Kevin:, Tuna Tuna Tuna.,no4-02.php
Andy:," He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.",no4-02.php

Michael:, [driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,no4-02.php
Dwight:, I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.,no4-02.php

Ex-client:, No he's right.,no4-02.php
Dwight:," Accept it, why would he come back?",no4-02.php
Michael:," Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",no4-02.php
Dwight:, That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.,no4-02.php
Michael:," Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.",no4-02.php

Michael:," I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.",no4-02.php
Dwight:," That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.",no4-02.php
Michael:," That is a very good point, Dwight.",no4-02.php

Dwight:," Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.",no4-02.php

Michael:, Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right],no4-02.php
Dwight:, It can't mean that! There's a lake there!,no4-02.php

Dwight:, Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.,no4-02.php
Michael:," What a disaster, this whole thing.",no4-02.php
Dwight:, I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone],no4-02.php

Phyllis:,  I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.,no4-03.php
Angela:,"  Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?",no4-03.php

You're making me throw up, Ryan.",no4-03.php

Pizza guy:, You better think about what you're doing.,no4-03.php
Michael:," No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",no4-03.php

Michael:, I am.,no4-04.php
Mr. Figaro:," Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.",no4-04.php
Michael:," I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.

Michael:," Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?",no4-04.php

Michael:, No you didn't.,no4-04.php
Creed:," Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.",no4-04.php

Creed:," You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up ""get out of jail free"" cards, those things cost thousands.",no4-04.php
Michael:, That is a good point.,no4-04.php
Creed:," Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.",no4-04.php

Oscar:, Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?,no4-04.php
Michael:," That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core.",no4-04.php

Oscar:, I'm done!,no4-04.php

Jan:," [on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don't, I don't get this.  I really don't.  I don't know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don't know what more to say.",no4-04.php

Michael:, That's really nice of you to say.,no4-04.php
Jan:," Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That's just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where's this train taking us?",no4-04.php

Dwight:," [takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.",no4-04.php

Michael:,  I can't go back to that.,no4-04.php
Jan:,  I think you can.  I... what?,no4-04.php

Andy:,"  I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?",no4-04.php
Dwight:,"  Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.",no4-04.php

Pam:, Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.,no4-10.php
Jim:," Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.",no4-10.php
Pam:, Nature.,no4-10.php

Pam:, [to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,no4-10.php
Michael:," Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. ",no4-10.php
Pam:," But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.",no4-10.php
Pam:," Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it. ",no4-10.php

Michael:," Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",no4-10.php
Pam:, I definitely remember your dinner party. ,no4-10.php
Michael:, I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. ,no4-10.php
Pam:," Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.",no4-10.php
Michael:, What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,no4-10.php
Michael:," Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]",no4-10.php
Creed:," [on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?",no4-10.php

Kevin:, It's a bitter situation. ,no4-10.php
Michael:, Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright. ,no4-10.php
Michael:," [sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...",no4-10.php

Michael:, Oooo. Catcher or in field?,no4-10.php
Phyllis:, Umm I don't know Michael.,no4-10.php

Phyllis:, What are you asking?,no4-10.php
Michael:, I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question. ,no4-10.php
Phyllis:," No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat. ",no4-10.php
Michael:," Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK! ",no4-10.php
Michael:, What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry. ,no4-10.php
Michael:," Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes. ",no4-10.php
Angela:, I don't think that this is---,no4-10.php
Michael:," Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear ""Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la."" No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. ",no4-10.php
Dwight:, [gets up from chair] Write legibly people. ,no4-10.php
Andy:," Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.",no4-10.php
Michael:, Hmm..,no4-10.php
Andy:, It's like a ten minute walk.,no4-10.php
Kevin:," No, thirty.",no4-10.php
Michael:," Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad. ",no4-10.php

Kevin:," Michael, please he--",no4-10.php
Michael:," What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves. ",no4-10.php
Andy:, We won't let you down. ,no4-10.php
Michael:," Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards. ",no4-10.php

Dwight:, Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.,no4-10.php
Michael:," Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.

Michael:," [clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.",no5-02.php
Phyllis:,  I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.,no5-02.php
Holly:, Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]",no5-02.php
Holly:," Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.",no5-02.php
Kelly:, What?,no5-02.php
Holly:," Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?",no5-02.php
Stanley:, This meeting.,no5-02.php

Holly:, I am?,no5-02.php
Micheal:," Yeah, don't think about the stakes.  It'll freak you out. ",no5-02.php

Michael:," [coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.",no5-02.php
Holly:," No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It's part of the ethics thing.",no5-02.php
Oscar:, That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.,no5-02.php
Andy:, I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!,no5-02.php
Oscar:," Exactly, Andy.",no5-02.php
Andy:,.  No big deal.,no5-02.php
Dwight:," It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. ",no5-02.php
Andy:, No that's... not how it works.,no5-02.php
Michael:, I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.,no5-02.php
Holly:," Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.",no5-02.php
Michael:," Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.",no5-02.php
Oscar:, Pass.,no5-02.php
Michael:, I didn't work for five days.  I did nothing.  I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.,no5-02.php
Holly:, What was the dilemma?,no5-02.php
Michael:, To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.,no5-02.php
Holly:,  Oh--- no no no.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.",no5-02.php

Jim:, Jackpot.,no5-02.php
Michael:, Ach! Wuh---,no5-02.php
Holly:," Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.",no5-02.php
Meredith:," Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?",no5-02.php
Michael:," That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.",no5-02.php
Michael:, Oh...,no5-02.php
Holly:, I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.,no5-02.php
Micheal:, Nnyeah.  What ya gonna do?,no5-02.php
Holly:," So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?",no5-02.php
Meredith:," Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.",no5-02.php
Michael:," Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.",no5-02.php
Meredith:, Am I in trouble here or something?,no5-02.php
Michael:," No... no, this is just a stupid formality.",no5-02.php
Holly:," No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?",no5-02.php
Meredith:," Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.",no5-02.php
Micheal:, Ughh!  For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag.,no5-02.php
Holly:," What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?",no5-02.php
Meredith:,"Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?",no5-02.php
Holly:, Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.,no5-02.php
Meredith:, Well... I'm not quitting.,no5-02.php
Jim:," [starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.",no5-02.php
Dwight:, What are you doing?,no5-02.php
Jim:, Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.,no5-02.php
Dwight:," Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]",no5-02.php
Jim:, Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.,no5-02.php
Dwight:, There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch],no5-02.php
Jim:, [stops the watch] One second.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.",no5-02.php
Holly:, It's Mike-raculous.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. ",no5-02.php
Holly:, Sounds good.,no5-02.php
Michael:, Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?,no5-02.php
Holly:, Oh I already bought this...,no5-02.php
Michael:," Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical.",no5-02.php
Holly:," So, I've gone over corporate policy.",no5-02.php
Michael:, What do you think?  What do you think of this place?,no5-02.php
Holly:," Oh, it's very nice.",no5-02.php
Michael:," Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?",no5-02.php
Holly:, Mmm.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Wow, that sounds so... warm.",no5-02.php
Holly:, In Summer.,no5-02.php
Michael:, Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?,no5-02.php
Holly:, Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.",no5-02.php
Michael:," Wow, terminator, terminator.",no5-02.php
Holly:, I'm from da future.,no5-02.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no5-02.php
Jim:," Hey, Andy.",no5-02.php
Andy:, Yo.,no5-02.php
Jim:," By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?",no5-02.php
Andy:," No, I did not.  Was that any good?",no5-02.php
Jim:, Actually not.  It was really so-so.,no5-02.php
Dwight:," Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]",no5-02.php
Jim:," I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?",no5-02.php
Andy:, Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?,no5-02.php
Jim:," You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.",no5-02.php
Andy:," Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.",no5-02.php
Jim:, Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.,no5-02.php
Andy:, Really?  That doesn't sound right.,no5-02.php
Michael:," I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.",no5-02.php
Michael:," Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.",no5-02.php
Holly:, We punish her?,no5-02.php
Michael:," Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.",no5-02.php
Holly:, I don't think we could enforce that.,no5-02.php
Michael:," I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.",no5-02.php
Holly:, A chastity belt.,no5-02.php
Michael:," No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...",no5-02.php
Jim:," He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.",no5-02.php
Michael:, I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.,no5-02.php
Holly:," No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.",no5-02.php
Michael:, Yes.,no5-02.php
Holly:, What am I saying?,no5-02.php
Michael:, Well... bleh busted.  I don't...,no5-02.php
Holly:, I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",no5-02.php
Holly:, It's not a family.  It's a workplace.,no5-02.php
Michael:, I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash],no5-02.php
Jim:, [Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?,no5-02.php
Dwight:, None of your business.,no5-02.php
Jim:, So I guess I can assume that was personal.,no5-02.php
Dwight:," [Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.",no5-02.php
Jim:, So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.,no5-02.php
Dwight:," Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]",no5-02.php
Holly:, It's been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.,no5-02.php
Ryan:,  Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.,no5-02.php
Michael:, What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?,no5-02.php
Ryan:, Two HR reps.,no5-02.php
Michael:, You get me.,no5-02.php
Holly:, Can I sit?,no5-02.php
Michael:," I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.",no5-02.php
Kendall:," [on speakerphone] Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..",no5-02.php
Holly:," Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.",no5-02.php
Michael:, Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.,no5-02.php
Kendall:," Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.",no5-02.php
Kendall:," Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area.  Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.",no5-02.php
Kendall:," I thought it was clear with you, Holly.  Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.",no5-02.php
Holly:," No, I understand.",no5-02.php
Kendall:, Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion.,no5-02.php
Holly:, No.  I can do it.,no5-02.php
Kendall:, Good.,no5-02.php
Michael:," How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, ""I told you so.""  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.",no5-02.php
Holly:," Can I have everyone's attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.",no5-02.php
Andy:," No way, lady.",no5-02.php
Kevin:, It's a trap.,no5-02.php
Holly:," Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.",no5-02.php
Meredith:, Don't sign anything.,no5-02.php
Michael:," Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",no5-02.php
Stanley:, It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.,no5-02.php
Michael:, Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room],no5-02.php
Meredith:, Am I getting fired?,no5-02.php
Michael:," Now is really not the time, Meredith.",no5-02.php
Holly:," In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.",no5-02.php
Phyllis:," Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.",no5-02.php
Meredith:," Hey, where is the steak sauce?",no5-02.php
Kevin:, I think we're out.,no5-02.php
Meredith:, I got some in my minivan somewhere.,no5-02.php
Andy:," Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?",no5-02.php
Kevin:," I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.",no5-02.php
Phyllis:, I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.,no5-02.php
Stanley:, Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming. ,no5-02.php
Holly:,  Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.,no5-02.php
Oscar:,  That's a big ethical area?,no5-02.php
Oscar:,"  Listen, I would love to have an honest conversation with management about ethics.  Why isn't the company doing better?  Mmm... it could be the pad of Post-its I took home last week.  Or it could be the twelve million dollars in deferred compensation in stock options they paid the CEO for a year of substandard performance.  I'm sure we'll cover both in the seminar.",no5-02.php
Creed:,"  I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.",no5-02.php
Phyllis:,"  During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.",no5-02.php
Holly:, Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the work place?,no5-02.php
Michael:, Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?,no5-02.php
Jim:," Oh, but you mean other than embezzling? ",no5-02.php
Ryan:," Fraud, Jim, Fraud.",no5-02.php
Jim:, Fraud.,no5-02.php
Ryan:," Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.",no5-02.php
Kevin:," Wait, what?",no5-02.php
Kevin:, You knocked the mirror off of my car.,no5-02.php
Ryan:," Yeah, isn't that messed up? ",no5-02.php
Kevin:, Yeah.,no5-02.php
Ryan:, That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.,no5-02.php
Kevin:," Wait, when you say ""that guy"", you mean you?",no5-02.php
Ryan:," I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]",no5-02.php
Kevin:," No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?",no5-02.php
Ryan:," Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions. ",no5-02.php
Kevin:," But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?",no5-02.php
Ryan:, If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.,no5-02.php
Kevin:, It was like two hundred dollars.,no5-02.php
Ryan:," We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]",no5-02.php
Ryan:," Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?",no5-02.php
Kevin:," Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]",no5-02.php
Meredith:,  What are we gonna do?,no5-02.php
Stanley:,  About what?,no5-02.php
Meredith:,  Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?,no5-02.php
Phyllis:,  Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.,no5-02.php
Meredith:,  No.  Something I can blackmail her with.,no5-02.php
Phyllis:,"  One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.",no5-02.php
Meredith:,"  Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?",no5-02.php
Stanley:,"  No, that was you.",no5-02.php
Meredith:,  You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.,no5-02.php
Meredith:,"  Hey, how did it go?",no5-02.php
Michael:,"  Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?",no5-02.php
Meredith:,  Okay. [remains sitting],no5-02.php
Michael:,  What do you need?,no5-02.php
Meredith:,"  I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.",no5-02.php
Michael:,  I... really want to keep you.,no5-02.php
Meredith:,  Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?,no5-02.php
Michael:,"  Wait, what?",no5-02.php
Meredith:,  I wish Toby was still here.,no5-02.php
Michael:,  Nnnngah!,no5-02.php
Receptionist:," Pam, line three.",no5-04.php
Pam:," Okay, thanks.",no5-04.php
Pam:," New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.",no5-04.php

Michael:, Hey.,no5-04.php
Holly:, Hello.,no5-04.php
Michael:, That was really fun last night.,no5-04.php
Holly:," Yeah, it was nice.",no5-04.php
Michael:, I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.,no5-04.php
Holly:," Oh, that would be great. You need that.",no5-04.php
Michael:, Yeah?,no5-04.php
Holly:, Yeah.,no5-04.php
Michael:, Oh really?,no5-04.php
Holly:, Yeah.,no5-04.php
Michael:, Well...,no5-04.php
Holly:, It would help.,no5-04.php
Michael:," I, uh... [to camera] I let her win.",no5-04.php
Holly:," [to camera] No, he didn't.",no5-04.php
Michael:," So, when, um, can I see you again?",no5-04.php
Holly:," Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs] ",no5-04.php
Michael:, No.,no5-04.php
Holly:," I don't care, free tonight.",no5-04.php
Michael:," Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.",no5-04.php
Holly:," [gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.",no5-04.php
Michael:, [concerned] Why?,no5-04.php
Holly:, I'm going out with you.,no5-04.php

Holly:, [shakes head] No more.,no5-04.php
Michael:, Tonight's so...,no5-04.php

Holly:," Thank you, you too.",no5-04.php
Michael:, You're welcome.,no5-04.php
Michael:," In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.",no5-04.php
Andy:," That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.",no5-04.php
Dwight:, [whispering] You set a date?,no5-04.php
Andy:," J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.",no5-04.php

Dwight:, You got a better way?,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, You want to talk about it?,no5-04.php
Dwight:, About what?,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.,no5-04.php
Dwight:," I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.",no5-04.php
Holly:," Oh, the mall could be fun.",no5-04.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no5-04.php
Holly:, We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.,no5-04.php
Michael:," Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?",no5-04.php
Holly:, ...Hell yeah.,no5-04.php
Michael:," Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.",no5-04.php
Holly:," Yeah, that's good.",no5-04.php
Michael:, Probably get soup or something light. ,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, Hi.,no5-04.php

Dwight:, I just don't get it.,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, What don't you get?,no5-04.php
Dwight:, Why is she marrying Andy?,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.,no5-04.php
Dwight:, That's really fattening.,no5-04.php
Phyllis:," No, it's lettuce.",no5-04.php
Holly:, [playing cards] It's time to go.,no5-04.php
Michael:," No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.",no5-04.php

Michael:, All right.,no5-04.php
Holly:," Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]",no5-04.php
Michael:, Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing],no5-04.php
Holly:," I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?",no5-04.php
Michael:, Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.,no5-04.php
Holly:," Oh, good.",no5-04.php
Michael:, We're totally alone.,no5-04.php

Kevin:," Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.",no5-04.php
Oscar:, How does that even compare?,no5-04.php
Kevin:," Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.",no5-04.php
Michael:," Oh, my God, what happened?",no5-04.php
Jim:, We were robbed last night.,no5-04.php
Dwight:," Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.",no5-04.php
Holly:, Can I talk to you for a second?,no5-04.php
Michael:, Yeah. Oh... oh!,no5-04.php
Holly:," That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?",no5-04.php
Michael:," No, did you?",no5-04.php

Dwight:, Get in.,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, Where are we going?,no5-04.php
Dwight:," I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.",no5-04.php
Phyllis:," Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.",no5-04.php
Dwight:, Are you sure that's going to work?,no5-04.php
Phyllis:, It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.,no5-04.php

Andy:," I don't care, so it doesn't matter.",no5-05.php
Angela:," Great, then it doesn't matter.",no5-05.php
Andy:," You don't think he could get in, though....right? I mean, I don't care, but I just don't see how he could. I doubt he could get in.",no5-05.php
Angela:, [reverently] He is fiercely intelligent.,no5-05.php
Andy:," I don't care either way, so....shut up.",no5-05.php
Angela:, He's just....,no5-05.php
Andy:," [in parking lot on cell phone] Don't tell me to calm down, Dad! [grunts] Don't do that! Oh, God, of all people, I thought you would understand. You're an alum. This guy, he's....he's poking the bear! [listens briefly] Yeah, okay, I'll see you at Thanksgiving. Hi to Mom. Bye.",no5-05.php
Angela:, Why are you doing this to Andy?,no5-05.php
Dwight:," You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.",no5-05.php
Angela:," [looks at Dwight disgustedly and sighs] Even if you do somehow get in, that's not going to make me leave Andy.",no5-05.php
Dwight:," No, but it'll make you respect him less.",no5-05.php
Angela:," [sighs] Yes, that's true.",no5-05.php
Dwight:, What is this?,no5-10.php
Jim:," Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.",no5-10.php
Dwight:, You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?,no5-10.php
Jim:, Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.,no5-10.php
Dwight:,"  Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",no5-10.php
Jim:, I think it'll take you a little longer than that.,no5-10.php
Dwight:," Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]",no5-10.php
Stanley:, Eh...,no5-10.php
Phyllis:,  I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.,no5-10.php
Stanley:, I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat],no5-10.php
Phyllis:," This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is ""Nights in Morocco"".  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.",no5-10.php
Michael:," Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party? ",no5-10.php
Phyllis:, Yes.,no5-10.php
Michael:, Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,no5-10.php
Phyllis:, Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.,no5-10.php
Angela:, It's the nativity scene.,no5-10.php
Phyllis:,"  Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.",no5-10.php
Angela:, I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.  ,no5-10.php
Phyllis:, I need you to get rid of the tree.,no5-10.php
Angela:, But--,no5-10.php
Phyllis:, Thank you.,no5-10.php
Phyllis:," Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.",no5-10.php
Jim:, Ah. You brought in your doll collection.,no5-10.php
Dwight:," These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.  ",no5-10.php
Dwight:,"  Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: ""My horn can pierce the sky"".  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]",no5-10.php
Jim:, That's the Christmas spirit. ,no5-10.php
Dwight:, I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,no5-10.php
Jim:, Yes.,no5-10.php
Michael:," Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",no5-10.php
Dwight:, They are now.,no5-10.php
Michael:, Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.,no5-10.php
Michael:," This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",no5-10.php
Meredith:, [drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.,no5-10.php
Michael:,  Alright... One more time around the block.,no5-10.php
Jim:, I will grant you one wish.,no5-10.php
Pam:, I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,no5-10.php
Jim:, Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.,no5-10.php
Andy:," [sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]",no5-10.php
Angela:, Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.,no5-10.php
Andy:, [sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.,no5-10.php
Michael:,"  Jim, Jim....",no5-10.php
Jim:, What is it?,no5-10.php
Michael:, That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.,no5-10.php
Jim:," Wow, that is delicious.",no5-10.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no5-10.php
Jim:, Can't believe no ones thought of that.,no5-10.php
Michael:, I know.,no5-10.php

Andy:, Sorry.,no5-10.php
Oscar:," We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?",no5-10.php
Michael:," Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",no5-10.php
Oscar:, What about February 2nd?,no5-10.php
Jim:, Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,no5-10.php
Michael:," No, no. I celebrate privately.",no5-10.php
Jim:, That's cool.,no5-10.php
Michael:, Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.,no5-10.php
Oscar:, Now? It's our Christmas party.,no5-10.php
Michael:, We'll do it quickly.,no5-10.php
Jim:, Well what if we can't do it quickly.,no5-10.php
Michael:, [mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--,no5-10.php
Oscar:, Do you know how to do an intervention?,no5-10.php
Michael:," Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",no5-10.php
Michael:," An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.",no5-10.php
Phyllis:," It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.",no5-10.php
Angela:, I don't--,no5-10.php
Phyllis:,  And napkins... fanned.,no5-10.php
Michael:," Okay, how do you feel?",no5-10.php
Meredith:, A little better. I threw up.,no5-10.php
Michael:, Uck... T.M.I.,no5-10.php
Kevin:, Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?,no5-10.php
Jim:, Yeah.,no5-10.php
Michael:,"  Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",no5-10.php
Toby:," Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.",no5-10.php
Michael:, I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,no5-10.php
Meredith:, I'm not an alcoholic.,no5-10.php
Michael:," Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]",no5-10.php
Dwight:, Aye.,no5-10.php
Michael:, The aye's have it.,no5-10.php
Meredith:, I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic. ,no5-10.php
Michael:," Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]",no5-10.php
Andy:,"  When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz. ",no5-10.php
Michael:," Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",no5-10.php
Meredith:, Sure.,no5-10.php
Michael:,  Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,no5-10.php
Meredith:, Obviously.,no5-10.php
Michael:, Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,no5-10.php
Oscar:, Where did you get this?,no5-10.php
Michael:," I got it on a website, that's not important.",no5-10.php
Toby:," Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don't know what your doing.",no5-10.php
Michael:," Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?",no5-10.php
Kelly:," Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.",no5-10.php
Michael:," Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.",no5-10.php
Kevin:," Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.",no5-10.php
Michael:,  That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.,no5-10.php
Kevin:," Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith. ",no5-10.php
Meredith:, You're welcome.,no5-10.php
Michael:," Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?",no5-10.php
Dwight:," No, I like Meredith.",no5-10.php
Dwight:,"  Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.",no5-10.php
Michael:, Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,no5-10.php
Meredith:, I am fine.,no5-10.php
Michael:," Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",no5-10.php
Meredith:,  I know I drink. I like to party,no5-10.php
Michael:, I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.,no5-10.php
Meredith:, I am not an alcoholic!,no5-10.php
Michael:," You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.",no5-10.php
Phyllis:, I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.,no5-10.php
Angela:, Please stop making me do these things.,no5-10.php
Phyllis:," Oh, sorry, it's your job.",no5-10.php
Angela:, But it's the season of mercy.,no5-10.php
Phyllis:, You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?,no5-10.php
Angela:, I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on],no5-10.php
Phyllis:, Ok... nice.,no5-10.php
Meredith:, I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.,no5-10.php
Michael:," [amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",no5-10.php
Dwight:, I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.,no5-10.php
Dwight:," There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.",no5-10.php
Michael:," Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",no5-10.php
Dwight:," Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.",no5-10.php
Michael:, Dwight--,no5-10.php
Dwight:, She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,no5-10.php
Michael:, [sighs]...okay.,no5-10.php
Dwight:, I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,no5-10.php
Jim:," Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.",no5-10.php
Dwight:," Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.",no5-10.php
Creed:, I can get you one in an hour. ,no5-10.php
Dwight:, Really?,no5-10.php
Toby:," Okay you know, this-- this is over.",no5-10.php
Stanley:, I agree.,no5-10.php
Jim:," Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",no5-10.php
Michael:," Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",no5-10.php
Michael:," You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",no5-10.php
Jim:, [watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.,no5-10.php
Pam:," I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]",no5-10.php
Phyllis:, That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out],no5-10.php
Stanley:, Mmmm... chewy.,no5-10.php
Jim:, [Andy playing the sitar] Hey. ,no5-10.php
Andy:, What's up?,no5-10.php
Jim:, Do you take requests? ,no5-10.php
Andy:, Sure.,no5-10.php
Jim:, Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.,no5-10.php
Michael:, [whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? ,no5-10.php
Toby:, Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow...,no5-10.php
Meredith:, We just missed Poor Richards.,no5-10.php
Michael:, We did?,no5-10.php
Meredith:," Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?",no5-10.php
Michael:," Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.",no5-10.php
Meredith:," The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...",no5-10.php
Michael:," We could go there, sure.",no5-10.php
Meredith:," ...Brixx's, Carmen's...",no5-10.php
Michael:," Yes, yes.",no5-10.php
Meredith:," ...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.",no5-10.php

Meredith:," Well, it must have just opened up.",no5-10.php
Michael:," It-- yep, recently.",no5-10.php
Meredith:, Yeah... all right.,no5-10.php
Michael:, All right.,no5-10.php
Meredith:, Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!,no5-10.php
Michael:," Yeah, oh there you go.",no5-10.php
Meredith:, Yeah!,no5-10.php
Michael:, That's good.,no5-10.php
Meredith:, Yeah that's better.,no5-10.php
Michael:, We're party girls.,no5-10.php
Toby:," [on phone] Hey Sasha, it's daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?",no5-10.php
Sasha:," [shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!!",no5-10.php
Toby:," No, No, No.  No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.",no5-10.php
Toby:, This is great.  My ex-wife's going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.,no5-10.php

Darryl:, Thanks man.,no5-10.php
Toby:, I was-- I was gonna get the doll.,no5-10.php
Dwight:, Not my problem.,no5-10.php
Toby:," But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll.  I-- I'm-- I'm begging you.  I just-- I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.",no5-10.php

Angela:, Shut up.,no5-10.php
Phyllis:, Excuse me?,no5-10.php
Angela:," I'm not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.",no5-10.php
Phyllis:," Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.",no5-10.php

Pam:, It's Christmas.,no5-10.php
Jim:, You knew it.,no5-10.php
Pam:, Thank you. I knew it.,no5-10.php
Jim:, She knew it.,no5-10.php
Michael:, As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.,no5-10.php
Andy:," All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.

Angela:,  I think I'd like to go home now.,no5-10.php
Andy:,"  Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.",no5-10.php
Dwight:," Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives.

Dwight:, [looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky? ,no5-13.php

Dwight:," Oh, how did that happen?",no5-13.php
Kevin:, It's out in the hall.,no5-13.php

Michael:," Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm. ",no5-13.php
Dwight:," What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?",no5-13.php
Michael:, Stay [bleep] calm!,no5-13.php
Dwight:," Wait, wait, wait.",no5-13.php
Michael:," Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!",no5-13.php

Everyone:, [groaning] Oh my God.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Not a viable option.,no5-13.php
Pam:, Try a different door.,no5-13.php
Dwight:," Okay, what's next?",no5-13.php
Michael:, Don't run.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?,no5-13.php
Andy:,  It-- it's warm.,no5-13.php

Everyone:, [shouting] Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!,no5-13.php
Dwight:," Calm, please",no5-13.php

Angela:, [pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay.  Shh shhh.,no5-13.php
Dwight:," A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.",no5-13.php
Angela:, Oscar.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, What's next? ,no5-13.php
Angela:, Oscar!,no5-13.php
Oscar:, Stay alive!  I'm getting help!,no5-13.php
Angela:, Pull me up!,no5-13.php
Oscar:, You're too heavy!,no5-13.php
Angela:, I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!,no5-13.php
Dwight:," How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]",no5-13.php
Pam:, What do we do? ,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.,no5-13.php
Jim:," Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]",no5-13.php
Angela:, What is that?  What is that?,no5-13.php
Andy:, The fire's shooting at us!,no5-13.php
Phyllis:, What in the name of God is going on?!,no5-13.php
Andy:," Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!",no5-13.php

Michael:, [throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!,no5-13.php
Stanley:, I'm about to die!,no5-13.php
Dwight:, [blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.,no5-13.php
Jim:, What?!,no5-13.php
Dwight:," Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.",no5-13.php
Michael:," No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.",no5-13.php

Andy:, You're choking him! ,no5-13.php
Michael:, Saving him!,no5-13.php
David Wallace:,  How could you possibly think this is a good idea?,no5-13.php
Dwight:, A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.,no5-13.php
Michael:, Electricity.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Shampoo.,no5-13.php
David Wallace:, You could have burned down the whole building.,no5-13.php
Dwight:," I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days. ",no5-13.php
Lawyer:," Did you shout, ""Fire!"", causing a panic?",no5-13.php
Dwight:," Yes I shouted ""fire!"".  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--",no5-13.php
Michael:, Hed. Hedded,no5-13.php
Dwight:, When no one hedded--  ,no5-13.php
Michael:, Take hedded of.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.,no5-13.php

Lawyer:, Wh--what?,no5-13.php
Michael:," Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. ",no5-13.php
David Wallace:," No, we are mad. ",no5-13.php
Michael:, Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.,no5-13.php
David Wallace:,"  No, we're not. ",no5-13.php
Michael:," I am not a mind reader, David. ",no5-13.php
David:," Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.",no5-13.php
Michel:," Can you shove down?  Instead... shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer. ",no5-13.php
Dwight:, No.,no5-13.php
Michael:, And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like. ,no5-13.php
Dwight:, PETA.,no5-13.php
David Wallace:," Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack.  He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run.  Do you want that on your conscious?",no5-13.php
Michael:, Do you?,no5-13.php
David Wallace:, Michael?,no5-13.php
Michael:, You talking to me?,no5-13.php
David Wallace:, Yeah.,no5-13.php
Michael:, What?,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?,no5-13.php
Michael:," [sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.",no5-13.php
Dwight:, Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?,no5-13.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping. ,no5-13.php
Michael:, That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, What? You?,no5-13.php
Michael:, Yes. ,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Come on.,no5-13.php
Michael:, I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, That's preposterous.,no5-13.php
Michael:," No, I will.",no5-13.php
Michael:," Nobody should have to go to work thinking, ""Oh, this is the place that I might die today.""  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true. ",no5-13.php
Michael:," Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley. ",no5-13.php
Stanley:," Thank you, Michael.",no5-13.php
Stanley:," It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people... ",no5-13.php
Stanley:, [flashback] Not maybe. Yes or no. ,no5-13.php
Stanley:, [flashback] No way. Uh-uh.  ,no5-13.php
Stanley:, [flashback] Are you from another planet?,no5-13.php
Stanley:," [flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.",no5-13.php
Stanley:, [flashback] Did I stutter?,no5-13.php
Stanley:, [flashback] I'm done. Goodbye.,no5-13.php
Stanley:, But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.,no5-13.php
Michael:, Andy.,no5-13.php
Andy:, [in a British accent] A throne for your highness. ,no5-13.php
Stanley:, I'm not sitting in a wheelchair. ,no5-13.php
Michael:," No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.",no5-13.php
Stanley:, I'm going to die.,no5-13.php
CPR trainer:," A-B-C. Okay?  And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation. ",no5-13.php
Michael:," Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means ""always be closing.""",no5-13.php
Dwight:, This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,no5-13.php
Michael:, Shut it.  Shut it.,no5-13.php
Michael:," We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket. ",no5-13.php
Kevin:, [giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.,no5-13.php
CPR Trainer:, It's been 20 seconds.,no5-13.php
Kevin:, Call it. ,no5-13.php
CPR Trainer:, Would you like to try next?,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Absolutely I would not.,no5-13.php
Michael:, You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,no5-13.php
Stanley:," Oh, I don't know.",no5-13.php
Phyllis:," That's not a good idea, Michael.",no5-13.php
Michael:, Come on.,no5-13.php
Phyllis:, He needs to rest.,no5-13.php
Michael:, No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?,no5-13.php
Stanley:, I would die.,no5-13.php
Michael:, And you're okay with that?,no5-13.php
Stanley:, I'm okay with the logic of it.,no5-13.php
Michael:," Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this. ",no5-13.php
Stanley:," Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I'm working in my own casket.",no5-13.php
Michael:, Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it!,no5-13.php
Angela:, Michael!,no5-13.php
Michael:, This is you we're talking about.,no5-13.php
Angela:, Michael.,no5-13.php
Michael:," Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.  ",no5-13.php
CPR Trainer:," So, assessing the situation.  Are they breathing? ",no5-13.php
Michael:," No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs. ",no5-13.php
Rose:," No, that's not part of it.",no5-13.php
Michael:," Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",no5-13.php
Kevin:, I would want to live with no legs. ,no5-13.php
Michael:," How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.",no5-13.php
Rose:," All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute . ",no5-13.php
Michael:," okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?",no5-13.php
Jim:, How's that gonna help you?,no5-13.php
Michael:, I will divide and then count to it.,no5-13.php
Jim:, Right.,no5-13.php
Rose:," Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees.  Do you know that song?",no5-13.php
Michael:," Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.",no5-13.php
Rose:," No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.",no5-13.php
Michael:," Okay, I got it.",no5-13.php
Creed:, [to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you. ,no5-13.php

Michael:," Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah... ",no5-13.php
Andy:," Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do! ",no5-13.php
Rose:, Okay! ,no5-13.php
Andy:," Da, da, da, da, da, da, da",no5-13.php
Rose:, Okay! ,no5-13.php
Everyone:," [muttering] Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.",no5-13.php
Rose:," Yeah, okay.  You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.",no5-13.php
Dwight:," Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? ",no5-13.php
Rose:, I have no idea.,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Anyone else?,no5-13.php
Phyllis:, We bury him?,no5-13.php
Dwight:,"  Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. ",no5-13.php
Creed:," He has no wallet, I checked. ",no5-13.php

Angela:, Oh my God! Dwight!,no5-13.php
Kelly:, Dwight!,no5-13.php
Angela:, What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?,no5-13.php
Dwight:, We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.,no5-13.php
Stanley:, I'm not feeling well.  I need to sit down. ,no5-13.php
Michael:," Hey, Stanley. ",no5-13.php
Andy:, Stanley. ,no5-13.php
Michael:, Are you okay?,no5-13.php
Angela:, Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own],no5-13.php
Stanley:, Oh my God!,no5-13.php
Angela:, Dwight!,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Clarice?,no5-13.php
Stanley:, Oh my God!,no5-13.php
David Wallace:, Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?,no5-13.php
Dwight:," I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.",no5-13.php
David Wallace:, We had to pay for it.  Cost us thirty five hundred dollars. ,no5-13.php
Michael:, Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Wow.,no5-13.php
Michael:," Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person. ",no5-13.php
Andy:," Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.",no5-13.php
Pam:," We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people. ",no5-13.php

Jim:," Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.",no5-13.php

Michael:, Let's hear it.,no5-13.php
Dwight:," [clears throat] ""I state my regret.""",no5-13.php
Jim:, You couldn't of memorized that?,no5-13.php
Dwight:," I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.",no5-13.php
Phyllis:, It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.,no5-13.php
Dwight:," Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!",no5-13.php

Jim:, [to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,no5-13.php
Andy:," Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",no5-13.php
Pam:, So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?,no5-13.php

Michael:, My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice... ,no5-13.php
Michael:," [everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful.

Jim:, Don't open your eyes.,no5-13.php
Pam:," What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh... ",no5-13.php
Michael:," And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream.

Pam:," Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",no5-13.php

Michael:, I don't get it. Do I stress you out?,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.,no5-13.php
Michael:, Oh... ,no5-13.php
Dwight:, Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology],no5-13.php
Michael:," Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge. ",no5-13.php
Michael:," Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...

Kelly:, A vacation.,no5-13.php
Michael:," What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right?

I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.",no5-13.php
Kevin:, [giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...,no5-13.php
Oscar:, I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.,no5-13.php
Michael:, I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,no5-13.php
Dwight:," May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.",no5-13.php

Michael:," Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",no5-13.php
Pam:," Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]",no5-13.php
Michael:," Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.",no5-13.php
Darryl:," Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?",no5-13.php

And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.",no5-13.php
Michael:," Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]",no5-13.php
Pam:," Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.",no5-13.php
Dwight:," It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.",no5-13.php

Creed:, What's a text?,no5-13.php
Michael:, [at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw... ,no5-13.php
Michael:," You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.",no5-13.php

Pam:,"  Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.",no5-13.php
Jim:, So what did he say? Was it my fault?,no5-13.php
Pam:," Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",no5-13.php
Jim:, You ok?,no5-13.php
Pam:, Yeah. [they hug],no5-13.php
Pam:,"  When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]",no5-13.php
Andy:," I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad. ",no5-13.php

Michael:," I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names.

Jim:," Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?",no5-15.php
Dwight:," Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]",no5-15.php
Jim:," Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.",no5-15.php
Dwight:," Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?",no5-15.php
Jim:," Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.",no5-15.php

Kelly:," You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?",no5-15.php
Jim:," That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.",no5-15.php
Dwight:," Our theme, if you will.",no5-15.php
Jim:," Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.",no5-15.php

Michael:," Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.",no5-16.php
Michael:," Pam, really, they're back?",no5-16.php
Pam:, I can't see them when they're on the floor,no5-16.php

Michael:," Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.",no5-16.php
Jim:," Oh, I'm sorry.",no5-16.php
Michael:," Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.",no5-16.php
Jim:, I understand that. ,no5-16.php
Dwight:, So sexy it becomes hostile.,no5-16.php
Michael:, Mm-hmm.,no5-16.php

Oscar:, He's on one of his honeymoons.,no5-16.php

Michael:," These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.

Kelly:," Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.",no5-16.php
Meredith:, She could be your soul mate.,no5-16.php
Dwight:," Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.",no5-16.php
Oscar:, It's possible.,no5-16.php
Kelly:, She could be.,no5-16.php

Jim:, Here they come. ,no5-16.php
Pam:, [looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?,no5-16.php
Jim:," No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.",no5-16.php
Pam:," Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.",no5-16.php
Jim:," Oh great, I have to cover?",no5-16.php
Pam:, Do you think they dined and dashed?,no5-16.php
Jim:," Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.",no5-16.php
Pam:, I thought we were having a nice time.,no5-16.php
Jim:, We were.,no5-16.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no5-16.php
Jim:, [emerging from the Men's room] Empty.,no5-16.php
Pam:, [exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate],no5-16.php
Jim:, Oh boy.,no5-16.php
Pam:, My God. ,no5-16.php
Jim:, OK.,no5-16.php
Girl:, Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl],no5-16.php
Michael:, Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.,no5-16.php
Bob:, OK then.,no5-16.php
Jim:, So...,no5-16.php
Bob:, Where were we?,no5-16.php
Phyllis:, [out of breath] Bowling.,no5-16.php
Pam:," Yep, that, yeah.",no5-16.php
Bob:, You didn't eat much there Jimbo.,no5-16.php
Jim:, Oh initially I did.,no5-16.php
Bob:, Want some meat?,no5-16.php
Phyllis:," Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.",no5-16.php
Bob:, Forgot.,no5-16.php
Phyllis:," Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]",no5-16.php
Kevin:," Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is. ",no5-16.php
Lynn:, That's really sweaty.,no5-16.php
Kevin:, Are you on email?,no5-16.php
Lynn:," Oh, yeah. [gives Kevin her card]",no5-16.php
Kevin:, Cool. Bye.,no5-16.php
Lynn:," Bye, Kevin.",no5-16.php
Kevin:, Good Valentine's.,no5-16.php
Dwight:," So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.",no5-16.php
Blonde:, OK. [Blonde stands up to leave],no5-16.php
Dwight:," OK, what's up?",no5-16.php
Blonde:," Look, I'm gonna go...",no5-16.php
Dwight:," Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--",no5-16.php
Blonde:," Look, we already have a paper supplier.",no5-16.php
Dwight:," OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!",no5-16.php

Michael:," You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.",no5-16.php
Oscar:," Come on, we'll all go.",no5-16.php
Michael:, [after some encouragement] OK.,no5-16.php
Michael:," Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.",no5-16.php
Stanley:," Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.",no5-16.php
Blood Drive Worker:, Of course. [noticing Stanley's arm] That's weird.  You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using Band-Aids.,no5-16.php
Stanley:," [backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.",no5-16.php

Pam:, [on the phone] Sure. Uh huh. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Pam? Knock, knock.",no5-17.php

Pam:," 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]",no5-17.php
Pam:, [sighs] Who's there?,no5-17.php
Michael:, Buddha.,no5-17.php
Pam:, Buddha who?,no5-17.php
Michael:," [puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]",no5-17.php
Pam:, Great. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," I, I need something to wipe my hand. ",no5-17.php
Pam:," Now there's, there's butter on my desk. ",no5-17.php
Michael:, That was helping. It was classic.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, I got a knock-knock joke. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, No... God.,no5-17.php
Dwight:," OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.",no5-17.php
Michael:, Alright. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:," [clears throat] Knock, knock.",no5-17.php
Michael:, Who's there?,no5-17.php
Dwight:, KGB.,no5-17.php
Michael:, KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face],no5-17.php
Dwight:, [in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!,no5-17.php
Michael:, What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight],no5-17.php
Dwight:, What are you doing? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, What are you doing?,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!,no5-17.php
Michael:," You, you like that?  ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, Ding Dong.,no5-17.php
Michael:, [to Jim] Who's there? ,no5-17.php
Jim:, KGB.,no5-17.php
Michael:," Dwight, get the door. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, I'm not answering it. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Answer the door.,no5-17.php
Jim:, Ding dong. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:," No way, it's the KGB. ",no5-17.php
Jim:, Ding dong. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, I'm not answering that. You answer it.,no5-17.php
Michael:, I'm not gonna answer it ,no5-17.php
Dwight:," I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]",no5-17.php
Jim:, The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs],no5-17.php
Dwight:, It's true. ,no5-17.php
Pam:," [Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.",no5-17.php
Michael:," Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa. ",no5-17.php
Pam:," Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.",no5-17.php
Michael:," Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!",no5-17.php
Pam:, Jelly beans.,no5-17.php
Michael:," No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans! ",no5-17.php
Michael:," The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.",no5-17.php
Jim:, We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --,no5-17.php
Michael:, Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.',no5-17.php
Jim:, 'Free paper.',no5-17.php
Michael:, No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon. ,no5-17.php
Andy:," Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this... ",no5-17.php
Michael:," No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right? ",no5-17.php
Kevin:, I think I should call her. ,no5-17.php
Andy:, No! No! No! ,no5-17.php
Kevin:, Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today? ,no5-17.php
Andy:," [sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'",no5-17.php
Kevin:, But I do like her just the way she is. ,no5-17.php
Andy:, Well that's not what we agreed on. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, What are you doing? ,no5-17.php
Andy:, Huh?,no5-17.php
Jim:," [to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know. ",no5-17.php
Andy:, No.,no5-17.php
Pam:," You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out. ",no5-17.php
Andy:, You're asking him to give up all of his power. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, What power? ,no5-17.php
Kevin:," Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker. ",no5-17.php
Andy:," You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'",no5-17.php
Pam:, That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that? ,no5-17.php
Jim:, Well guys with girlfriends don't.,no5-17.php
Andy:," That's low, Tuna. ",no5-17.php
Jim:," [on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]",no5-17.php
Michael:, Woo hoo. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, [on phone] I'll take that down right now. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ,no5-17.php
Jim:, I'm on the phone. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? ,no5-17.php
Jim:, [on phone] Hold on one second. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Invite them on the tour. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, [to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",no5-17.php
Oscar:, Ten percent? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Yeah?,no5-17.php
Oscar:, They're our largest client. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no5-17.php
Oscar:, It's gonna hurt.,no5-17.php
Jim:," [on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't. ",no5-17.php
Jim:, How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, I thought I did. So...,no5-17.php
Jim:, OK...,no5-17.php
Michael:, Well no harm no foul.,no5-17.php
Jim:, ...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.,no5-17.php
Michael:," You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good. ",no5-17.php
Michael:, Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.,no5-17.php
Darryl:, Start over. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen? ,no5-17.php
Darryl:, Were the boxes near each other?,no5-17.php
Michael:, Irrelevant.  ,no5-17.php
Darryl:, I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet? ",no5-17.php
Michael:, My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs],no5-17.php
Pam:," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",no5-17.php
Pam:," When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right? ",no5-17.php
Oscar:, They can.,no5-17.php
Michael:," No, they can't. ",no5-17.php
Oscar:," Yes, they can. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.",no5-17.php
Oscar:," Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?",no5-17.php
Michael:," Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - ",no5-17.php
Jim:," So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," Thank you, Jim is with me.",no5-17.php
Jim:," Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.",no5-17.php
Michael:, Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,no5-17.php
Creed:, That's not why.,no5-17.php
Michael:," OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.",no5-17.php
Pam:, Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings],no5-17.php
Jim:, Good one. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",no5-17.php
Stanley:, I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?,no5-17.php
Michael:, That is not constructive.,no5-17.php
Pam:," [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," [on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--",no5-17.php
David:," [on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?",no5-17.php
Michael:, How are you doing? ,no5-17.php
David:, Fine. What is going on? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, [reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,no5-17.php
David:," Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen? ",no5-17.php
Michael:," Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.",no5-17.php
David:, How could you not know Michael? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant. ,no5-17.php
David:," Might have hi--- OK, what firm?",no5-17.php
Michael:, You're breaking up.,no5-17.php
David:, Michael? ,no5-17.php
Michael:," OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant. ",no5-17.php
David:, Was it the sales department? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Yes. ,no5-17.php
David:, Was it Jim? ,no5-17.php
Michael:, No.,no5-17.php
David:," OK, was it Dwight? ",no5-17.php
Michael:, [long pause] Yes.,no5-17.php
Michael:," [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.",no5-17.php
Dwight:, That was your idea. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Woah, wow, who told you that? ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, You did. Several times. Over and over again. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," [same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, [same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so... ,no5-17.php
Michael:, I'm not taking... I'm not taking... ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.",no5-17.php
Dwight:, You don't keep a diary.,no5-17.php
Michael:, Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Why do you have a diary?,no5-17.php
Dwight:, To keep secrets from my computer. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Impossible.,no5-17.php
Michael:," Yes, you did.",no5-17.php
Dwight:," I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math. ",no5-17.php
Michael:, What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary],no5-17.php
Dwight:, Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, With all my heart. ,no5-17.php
Kevin:, You guys are throwing a lot at me.,no5-17.php
Jim:," All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance. ",no5-17.php
Kevin:, Right.,no5-17.php
Pam:, I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.,no5-17.php
Jim:," No, that is what I mean.",no5-17.php
Pam:," [to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic. ",no5-17.php
Kevin:, [puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?,no5-17.php
Jim:," No, stop it.",no5-17.php
Andy:, Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.,no5-17.php
Andy:," [Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that. ",no5-17.php
Michael:, We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--,no5-17.php
Dwight:," OK, what am I thinking right now?",no5-17.php
Michael:," Umm, nacho chips.  ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, No... How skin is the largest organ of the body. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",no5-17.php
Dwight:," Oh, not gonna happen. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",no5-17.php
Dwight:, What about Shoe La La?,no5-17.php
Michael:, [sighs] It's not ready yet. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house. ",no5-17.php
Michael:," May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. ",no5-17.php
Oscar:, These aren't announcements. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Yes they are, you just don't care about the information. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, I love working here and I do not want to leave. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Well... ,no5-17.php
Michael:," I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Right.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,no5-17.php
Michael:, That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Try me.,no5-17.php
Michael:, That's why you made the decision. That's why you made... ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, I haven't made a decision yet.,no5-17.php
Michael:, You kind of have. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, No. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Yes.,no5-17.php
Jim:, You cannot take the fall for him.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, He said he would do the same for me. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.,no5-17.php
Jim:, There it is.,no5-17.php
Michael:," [seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation. ",no5-17.php
David:, That's too bad. ,no5-17.php
Michael:," Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?",no5-17.php
David:," Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.

Dwight:, David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations],no5-17.php
David:, I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping] ,no5-17.php
David:, Alright Dwight. This is huge.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, That's what she said! [David laughs],no5-17.php
Michael:," Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea? ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Inspiration.,no5-17.php
Michael:, Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?,no5-17.php
Dwight:, [same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Give me the details of how that happened.,no5-17.php
Jim:," You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.",no5-17.php
Michael:, What? ,no5-17.php
Jim:, And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Apology rejected.,no5-17.php
Pam:," [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Oh Pam. ,no5-17.php
Creed:," Good work, kid. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Thanks old man. ,no5-17.php
David:," This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Yeah.,no5-17.php
David:," Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?",no5-17.php
Pam:, Sure. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, David? David? ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, [same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea... ,no5-17.php
Michael:, David? ,no5-17.php
David:, Yeah?,no5-17.php
Michael:, Could I be a part of the meeting also?,no5-17.php
David:," You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting. ",no5-17.php
Jim:," Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs] ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Alright. ,no5-17.php
David:," [on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:," OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. ",no5-17.php
Man on phone:," Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? [cut to show Michael on the other line] I hear panting.",no5-17.php
David:, No. No dogs. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].,no5-17.php
Michael:, There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,no5-17.php
Pam:, It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Pam... ,no5-17.php
Michael:, I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, That is my idea.  ,no5-17.php
David:, [on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?,no5-17.php
Michael:," OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that? ",no5-17.php
David:," No, no.",no5-17.php
Dwight:, It is my idea.,no5-17.php
Michael:, Oh how dare you. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,no5-17.php
Michael:," You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Horse Boat. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, Oh please.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!,no5-17.php
Michael:, Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Oh give me a break.,no5-17.php
Michael:," ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, That's because they're easy! ,no5-17.php
Michael:, They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, [same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh... ,no5-17.php
David:," [same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true? ",no5-17.php
Dwight:," Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death. ",no5-17.php
Michael:, Thank You!,no5-17.php
David:," What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now? ",no5-17.php
Michael:," Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",no5-17.php
David:," OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes. ",no5-17.php
Pam:, OK.,no5-17.php
David:, I am gone. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, Oh I am. In my own words. ,no5-17.php
Michael:, I want to see it. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, No.,no5-17.php
Michael:, I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary],no5-17.php
Dwight:," No, Michael. ",no5-17.php
Michael:, Give me...  Give me the diary. ,no5-17.php
Dwight:, No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand],no5-17.php
Lynn:, Hi.,no5-17.php
Kevin:," Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking. ",no5-17.php
Lynn:, OK.,no5-17.php
Kevin:, I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie. ,no5-17.php
Lynn:, OK.,no5-17.php
Kevin:, Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes],no5-17.php
Andy:," Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh! ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, Ding dong. ,no5-17.php
Jim:, Who is it?,no5-17.php
Dwight:, KGB.,no5-17.php
Jim:," Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:," [in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?",no5-17.php
Jim:," Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, We have more houses to visit. ,no5-17.php
Jim:," If you want to come back then, that'll be fine. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:, We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?,no5-17.php
Jim:, I get back from work around 6.,no5-17.php
Dwight:, How about 5:15? ,no5-17.php
Jim:," You can try. That, that might work. ",no5-17.php
Dwight:," Very well, we will come back at 5:15.",no5-17.php
Jim:, Alright. ,no5-17.php
Michael:,"  It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.  ",no5-23.php
Michael:," [honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!",no5-23.php
Ryan:, We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.,no5-23.php
Michael:," Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.",no5-23.php
Pam:," We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says ""Alleluia Church of Scranton."" in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.",no5-23.php
Pam:," You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?",no5-23.php
Michael:, Milk and sugar.,no5-23.php
Pam:," Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?",no5-23.php
Michael:, That's what I said.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Do you drink this every day?,no5-23.php
Michael:, Every morning.,no5-23.php
Michael:," We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.",no5-23.php
Pam:," [an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.",no5-23.php
Charles:," Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?",no5-23.php
Jim:," Oh, they're my client.",no5-23.php
Charles:,"  No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," [sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.",no5-23.php
Charles:, In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.,no5-23.php
Stanley:, What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.,no5-23.php
Charles:, I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.,no5-23.php
Andy:," Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.",no5-23.php
Charles:, Why are you telling me this?,no5-23.php
Andy:, I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.  ,no5-23.php
Charles:, Is this something you really want to have said?,no5-23.php
Andy:, I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.  ,no5-23.php
Charles:," I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-",no5-23.php
Dwight:, It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.,no5-23.php
Charles:," I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh-- ",no5-23.php
Angela:," Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.",no5-23.php
Charles:," Uh, well said, Angela.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," Been there, done that.",no5-23.php
Michael:, You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.,no5-23.php
Ryan:," Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.",no5-23.php
Michael:," Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.",no5-23.php
Pam:, Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?,no5-23.php
Michael:," Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.  ",no5-23.php
Pam:," Yeah, I know what a loft is.",no5-23.php
Ryan:, Most dorm rooms don't even have that.,no5-23.php
Michael:, Most do in the magazines.,no5-23.php
Ryan:, Let's see what a delivery guy costs.,no5-23.php
Michael:, We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.,no5-23.php
David Wallace:,"  Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.",no5-23.php
Jim:," Hey, David.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.",no5-23.php
Charles:, There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?,no5-23.php
David:," A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure. ",no5-23.php
Charles:," Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.  ",no5-23.php
David:, Hmmm.,no5-23.php
Charles:, I feel like I should be thanking you.,no5-23.php
David:, Uh.,no5-23.php
Jim:," [makes kissing, puckering sound]",no5-23.php
Charles:, The conference room is ready if we want to get started.,no5-23.php
David:," You know, I just want to address everyone first.  ",no5-23.php
Charles:," Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.",no5-23.php
David:,"  Hi, everyone.",no5-23.php
Kelly:, Hi.,no5-23.php
David:," Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret-- ",no5-23.php
Kevin:, Hi.,no5-23.php
David:," Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.",no5-23.php
Charles:, Right.,no5-23.php
David:, Okay?,no5-23.php
Phyllis:," Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.",no5-23.php
David:," I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?",no5-23.php
Charles:," Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?",no5-23.php
David:, Hmm.,no5-23.php
Charles:," Yeah, Jim-- ",no5-23.php
David:, I find that extraordinarily surprising.,no5-23.php
Charles:," He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.",no5-23.php
David:, We'll bring them both in.,no5-23.php
Charles:," Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," Come along, afterthought.",no5-23.php
Michael:, How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:," Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct-- ",no5-23.php
Michael:," They are correct, sir.",no5-23.php
Financial Guy:, Then you can't afford to pay him anything.,no5-23.php
Michael:, Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:,  Your prices are too low.,no5-23.php
Michael:, Lowest in town.,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:, Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?,no5-23.php
Pam:, Corporate greed?,no5-23.php
Ryan:," Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.",no5-23.php
Financial Guy:," Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct.",no5-23.php
Ryan:, Yeah.,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:, But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.,no5-23.php
Michael:,"  Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.",no5-23.php
Ryan:, Explain what you think that is.,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:, Okay.,no5-23.php
Michael:, Explain that.,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:,"  As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care... ",no5-23.php
Michael:," Well, we don't-- ",no5-23.php
Financial Guy:, ...business expansion-- ,no5-23.php
Michael:," Whatever, yeah.",no5-23.php
Financial Guy:,"  At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.",no5-23.php
Michael:, Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.,no5-23.php
Financial Guy:,  They're actually putting you out of business.,no5-23.php
Michael:," Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.",no5-23.php
Ty:,  It's a program.  There's no such thing-- ,no5-23.php
Michael:, Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.,no5-23.php
Ty:, [presses key on computer] Crunch.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Did it help?,no5-23.php
Michael:," Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.  ",no5-23.php
Pam:," When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, ""Drive, kid.  I trust you.""",no5-23.php
Jim:," Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?",no5-23.php
Charles:," God, no.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.",no5-23.php
Charles:, I agree.,no5-23.php
Dwight:,  I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.  ,no5-23.php
Jim:, Really? Does he do good work or-- ,no5-23.php
Dwight:," [scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]",no5-23.php
David:," Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.",no5-23.php
Dwight:, Five minutes exactly.,no5-23.php
Charles:," Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?",no5-23.php
Dwight:, Sure thing.,no5-23.php
Charles:,  Yeah.,no5-23.php
Jim:, [opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.,no5-23.php
Jim :, You're just out of business? ,no5-23.php
Pam:, We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.  ,no5-23.php
Jim:," Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.  ",no5-23.php
Pam:, That's what Michael said.,no5-23.php
Jim:," Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying ""Idiot, Idiot, Idiot""] Oh, that's my new ""Dwight"" ring.  ",no5-23.php
Pam:, I like it.,no5-23.php
Jim:,"  Good, right?  Hello.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.",no5-23.php
Jim:," Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.",no5-23.php
Michael:, Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?,no5-23.php
Pam:," Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.",no5-23.php
Michael:, I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.  ,no5-23.php
Pam:, You want to hear something sad? ,no5-23.php
Michael:, I would love that. ,no5-23.php
Pam:," So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.",no5-23.php
Ryan:, I never went to Thailand.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Really?,no5-23.php
Ryan:, I went to Fort Lauderdale.  ,no5-23.php
Michael:, Was it nice?,no5-23.php
Ryan:," Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.",no5-23.php
Michael:, I love Pad Thai.,no5-23.php
Ryan:,  You've never had Pad Thai.,no5-23.php
Michael:, No.  There's a lot I haven't done. ,no5-23.php
Jim:," Now, this is the projection over three months? ",no5-23.php
Charles:, We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once],no5-23.php
Dwight:," Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?  ",no5-23.php
David:," Yeah, yeah.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.",no5-23.php
David:," I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.  ",no5-23.php
Charles:," Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.",no5-23.php
Jim:," Oh, but you didn't.",no5-23.php
Dwight:," Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.  ",no5-23.php
Charles:, What is wrong with you?,no5-23.php
David:," Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer? ",no5-23.php
Jim:," Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so-- ",no5-23.php
David:, Yeah.,no5-23.php
Jim:, I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.,no5-23.php
Dwight:," You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?",no5-23.php

Jim:," Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit. ",no5-23.php
Michael:, [knocking on door] Hmm?,no5-23.php
Jim:," Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second? ",no5-23.php
Michael:," We're not hiring, Jim.",no5-23.php
Jim:, Actually here for something else.,no5-23.php
Michael:," Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.  ",no5-23.php
Jim:," You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.",no5-23.php
Ryan:," Oh, that's nice.",no5-23.php
Jim:, David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Seriously?  Are you being serious?,no5-23.php
Ryan:," He's bluffing, Pam.",no5-23.php
Michael:," Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl-- ",no5-23.php
Jim:, Oh!,no5-23.php
Michael:, No-- We don't have-- ,no5-23.php
Jim:, Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.,no5-23.php
Michael:, [stammers] Uh... Yes.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Yes.,no5-23.php
Ryan:, Maybe.,no5-23.php

Michael:, That's a pun.,no5-23.php
Jim:, Got it.,no5-23.php
Michael:, Yep. Oh... wow.,no5-23.php
Ryan:," Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.",no5-23.php
Michael:, Of course not. ,no5-23.php
Ryan:, That we're having any problem at all.  ,no5-23.php
Michael:," Nope, nope, nope.",no5-23.php
Pam:," Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.",no5-23.php
Michael:," Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.",no5-23.php

Michael:, It is.  I'm good.,no5-23.php
Michael:, Hello.,no5-23.php
Erin:, Hi.,no5-23.php
Michael:," Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables... ",no5-23.php
David:," Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.",no5-23.php
Michael:, And we are prepared to reject that offer.,no5-23.php
Ryan:," Michael, you  haven't even heard-- ",no5-23.php
Michael:, Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer? ,no5-23.php
David:,"$12,000.00 ",no5-23.php
Michael:, Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.  ,no5-23.php
Angela:, What do you hear?,no5-23.php
Kelly:, [mumbles],no5-23.php
David:," Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.  ",no5-23.php
Michael:, I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.  ,no5-23.php
David:," Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael? ",no5-23.php

Michael:, We are so rich.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Are you kidding me?,no5-23.php
Dwight:," Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.",no5-23.php
Charles:, Dwight. ,no5-23.php
Dwight:,  May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.  ,no5-23.php
Charles:, What?  How'd you hear that?,no5-23.php
Dwight:,  They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.,no5-23.php
Jim:, Great work Dwight.,no5-23.php
Dwight:, Quiet you.,no5-23.php
Jim:," No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?",no5-23.php
Dwight:," You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.  ",no5-23.php
Charles:, So how long can they stay viable?,no5-23.php
Jim:, What are your top five cases?,no5-23.php
Dwight:, I'm gonna answer Charles first.,no5-23.php
Jim:,  Because you've solved zero cases.  ,no5-23.php
Dwight:," Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.  ",no5-23.php
Charles:," Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.",no5-23.php
Dwight:, Done.,no5-23.php
Charles:, Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?,no5-23.php
Dwight:, I'm not-- I'm not following you.,no5-23.php
Charles:, You two are morons.,no5-23.php
Jim:, Got it.,no5-23.php
Dwight:, Wh-- ,no5-23.php
Charles:, Get out.,no5-23.php
David:," So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?",no5-23.php
Michael:, No.  ,no5-23.php
Pam:, Can you give us another minute please?,no5-23.php
David:, Yeah.  ,no5-23.php
Charles:," Oh, okay.",no5-23.php
Pam:, Michael.,no5-23.php
Ryan:," How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.",no5-23.php
Pam:, Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?,no5-23.php
Michael:," It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?  ",no5-23.php
Ryan:," I would rather have $60,000, honestly.  ",no5-23.php
Pam:," No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.  ",no5-23.php
Michael:, Agreed?,no5-23.php
Pam:," Agreed.  But that's all, okay.",no5-23.php
Ryan:," Yeah, discuss these things-- ",no5-23.php
Michael:," Shut up, shut up.  Hello?",no5-23.php
Michael:, I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.,no5-23.php
Charles:,  They don't make them anymore.  ,no5-23.php
Michael:, And I want Charles gone.  ,no5-23.php
David:, I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.  ,no5-23.php
Charles:," That's very kind of you to say, David.  ",no5-23.php
Michael:, I need him gone.,no5-23.php
David:, No.  ,no5-23.php
Michael:," Okay, then I want Pam back.  ",no5-23.php
David:," Uh, you already have a new receptionist-- ",no5-23.php
Michael:,  Sales.,no5-23.php
Pam:, Thank you.  ,no5-23.php
David:, Pam's not a salesperson.,no5-23.php
Michael:," Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.  ",no5-23.php
Pam:, That's right.,no5-23.php
David:, Okay.  Please continue.,no5-23.php
Michael:, And Ryan.,no5-23.php
David:," Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is-- ",no5-23.php
Michael:," You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.",no5-23.php
David:, Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits-- ,no5-23.php
Michael:, And dental this time.,no5-23.php
David:," Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.  ",no5-23.php
Michael:, These are our demands.,no5-23.php
David:, Your company cannot be worth that much.  ,no5-23.php
Michael:," Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.",no5-23.php
David:, Michael-- ,no5-23.php
Michael:, That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.  ,no5-23.php
David:, Okay.  Deal.  Okay?,no5-23.php
Michael:, Can we have the room please?,no5-23.php
David:," Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]  ",no5-23.php
Ryan:," Yes, yes, yes!",no5-23.php
Pam:, Alright!,no5-23.php
Michael:, Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!,no5-23.php
Michael:, There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.  ,no5-23.php
Charles:," Hey, guys-- ",no5-23.php
Michael:," No, no. You're done. ",no5-23.php
Kevin:,"  At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?",no5-24.php
Ryan:, [whispering] Who is it?,no5-24.php
Pam:, [whispering] Who is it?,no5-24.php
Michael:," [whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:, [after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?,no5-24.php
Michael:," If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.  ",no5-24.php
Angela:, Okay.,no5-24.php
Michael:, Yes.,no5-24.php
Angela:, People are dressed inappropriately.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:,  Can you give us a hint?,no5-24.php
Michael:," When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.",no5-24.php
Michael:," Oscar, what were you going to say?",no5-24.php
Oscar:, Nothing.  I didn't say anything.,no5-24.php
Michael:,  All right.,no5-24.php
Erin:, Do I still have a job here?,no5-24.php
Michael:," Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Wait, what?",no5-24.php
Stanley:, How is that going to work?,no5-24.php
Michael:," It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--",no5-24.php
Phyllis:, You mean the clients you stole from us.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:," Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?",no5-24.php
Michael:,"  No, you lost those clients.  ",no5-24.php
Andy:," I call foul, sir.",no5-24.php
Michael:, Okay.,no5-24.php
Dwight:, You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients. ,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.  ",no5-24.php
Meredith:," [to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.",no5-24.php
Pam:,  [laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?  ,no5-24.php
Phyllis:, It sure looked good on the mannequin.  ,no5-24.php
Pam:," Well, you have good taste.",no5-24.php
Phyllis:," Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.  ",no5-24.php
Pam:, What?,no5-24.php
Phyllis:, Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?,no5-24.php
Pam:,"  Oh, I, um...",no5-24.php
Phyllis:," Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.",no5-24.php
Angela:, The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.  ,no5-24.php
Toby:, Can't you just not look at his feet?,no5-24.php
Angela:," Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!",no5-24.php
Toby:," Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," [hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.  ",no5-24.php
Ryan:," Oh, thanks, man.",no5-24.php
Michael:, Pamela.  ,no5-24.php
Pam:," Thank, Michael.",no5-24.php
Michael:, Yep.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Fresh hot ink.  ,no5-24.php
Stanley:," ""New File System"".",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.  ",no5-24.php
Stanley:, I am not changing the way I do my files.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:," No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:, When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.  ,no5-24.php
Oscar:," I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.  ",no5-24.php
Toby:,  I could loan you a pair of socks.  ,no5-24.php
Oscar:, No.,no5-24.php
Toby:," No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.  ",no5-24.php
Oscar:, I don't think so.,no5-24.php
Andy:,  Andrew Bernard.,no5-24.php
Dwight:," Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?",no5-24.php
Andy:, What are you still doing not at your desk?,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Did you even read the memo?  ,no5-24.php
Andy:,  All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:," No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.  ",no5-24.php
Andy:," Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:," We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:, Can I address that?,no5-24.php
Dwight:," No, you're too close.",no5-24.php
Jim:,  Okay.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:,"  Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?  ",no5-24.php
Stanley:, It's not right.  I don't like it. ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, He doesn't like it.  ,no5-24.php
Phyllis:," You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?  ",no5-24.php
Meredith:,  I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--,no5-24.php
Dwight:,  Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.  ,no5-24.php
Phyllis:, Those sound too harsh.,no5-24.php
Dwight:," No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:, Of course.  What is like a hostage?  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Excellent question.  ,no5-24.php
Andy:, We could write a strong-worded letter.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Words will never be enough.  ,no5-24.php
Jim:, Strongly-painted picture.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:," No, pictures are too interpretive.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:," Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:, Great.  See you upstairs.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:," C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--",no5-24.php
Pam:, That one's great.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, I know.  ,no5-24.php
Ryan:, You look so classy in that picture.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?,no5-24.php
Jim:," Hey, you have a second?",no5-24.php
Michael:, Michael Scott Paper Company only.  ,no5-24.php
Jim:," Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," Okay, well---",no5-24.php
Ryan:, Tough.,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:,"  This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:, Against who?,no5-24.php
Ryan:, You.  Us.  ,no5-24.php
Pam:, What?,no5-24.php
Ryan:,  It's gotta be because they all want their clients.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.  ",no5-24.php
Pam:, Mm-hmmm.,no5-24.php
Michael:," That was  us, right there.",no5-24.php
Pam:,  We were something else.  ,no5-24.php
Ryan:, What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, Mm-hmm.,no5-24.php
Ryan:, Chiklis style.,no5-24.php
Michael:," Yeah, the Commish.",no5-24.php
Ryan:," Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.",no5-24.php
Michael:," Yeah, yeah. The Shield.  ",no5-24.php
Creed:," It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?  ",no5-24.php
Jim:," I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--",no5-24.php
Creed:, Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.  ,no5-24.php
Jim:, That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.  ,no5-24.php
Creed:, Want to play a game?,no5-24.php
Michael:, Hey gang. Where you been?  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Lunch.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:,  Where'd you eat?  ,no5-24.php
Phyllis:, A restaurant.,no5-24.php
Michael:," What'd you have, Stanley?",no5-24.php
Andy:," I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair. ",no5-24.php
Stanley:, I had Mexican food.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.  ",no5-24.php
Ryan:,  That looks great.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?",no5-24.php
Ryan:, I can eat.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, It's pony. ,no5-24.php
Michael:, Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?,no5-24.php
Andy:, Dijonnaise.,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.",no5-24.php
Pam:, Mmm.  ,no5-24.php
Toby:," Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?  ",no5-24.php
Meredith:, About what?,no5-24.php
Toby:,  Your outfit.  ,no5-24.php
Meredith:, What? What's wrong with my outfit?,no5-24.php
Toby:, You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.  ,no5-24.php
Meredith:," A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?  ",no5-24.php
Oscar:," Meredith, your boob is out. ",no5-24.php
Meredith:," Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]",no5-24.php
Angela:," Meredith, too far!",no5-24.php
Kelly:," Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?  ",no5-24.php
Meredith:," It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]",no5-24.php
Creed:," [playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:," Well, what if I just do this?  ",no5-24.php
Creed:, You don't want to do that.  ,no5-24.php
Jim:, I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.  ,no5-24.php
Ryan:," I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.",no5-24.php
Ryan:, Exactly.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, That's my client.,no5-24.php

Stanley:, Who let this boy on the phone?,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!,no5-24.php
Pam:,"  You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.",no5-24.php
Dwight:, You're a secretary! What do you know?  ,no5-24.php
Ryan:, Okay.,no5-24.php
Dwight:,  And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.,no5-24.php
Michael:," Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.  ",no5-24.php

Phyllis:, Me.  ,no5-24.php
Stanley:, And me. ,no5-24.php
Andy:, Me too.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, You guys gotta be kidding.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:," No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.",no5-24.php
Stanley:, You want us to apologize to you?,no5-24.php
Michael:, Yes I do.  ,no5-24.php
Andy:, That's completely backwards.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:,  It's frontward's.,no5-24.php
Phyllis:," Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.  ",no5-24.php
Stanley:, That's right.,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Right.,no5-24.php
Phyllis:," Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.",no5-24.php
Michael:, I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.,no5-24.php
Dwight:, Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?,no5-24.php
Michael:,  Whatever you guys did earlier.,no5-24.php

Erin:, I really love your outfit.  ,no5-24.php
Kelly:, Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.  ,no5-24.php
Erin:, You look like J-Lo.,no5-24.php
Michael:," So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.  ",no5-24.php
Stanley:, Are you giving us our clients back?  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  ""apology accepted"", I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.",no5-24.php
Stanley:, Nobody likes that stuff except for you.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.  ,no5-24.php
Phyllis:," Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.",no5-24.php
Michael:," Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",no5-24.php
Stanley:, So?  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters ""okay""] However, I rescind my apology.  ",no5-24.php
Dwight:,  That's fair.,no5-24.php
Michael:, You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.  ,no5-24.php
Darryl:, What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?,no5-24.php
Ryan:," Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.  ",no5-24.php
Pam:, He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.  ,no5-24.php
Ryan:,  I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.,no5-24.php
Pam:, Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.,no5-24.php
Ryan:," If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.",no5-24.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no5-24.php
Ryan:, Thanks.,no5-24.php
Creed:," So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter. ",no5-24.php
Jim:,"  Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.  ",no5-24.php
Creed:, I thought you were gay.,no5-24.php
Jim:,  Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?,no5-24.php
Creed:,  I don't know.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?,no5-24.php
Jim:, Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.,no5-24.php
Michael:,  [puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.,no5-24.php
Creed:, Challenge.,no5-24.php
Michael:, I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.,no5-24.php
Jim:," I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:, You're close with Pam too.,no5-24.php
Jim:," Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.",no5-24.php
Michael:," Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:," Well, that's--",no5-24.php
Michael:, I like his hair.  ,no5-24.php
Jim:," Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.",no5-24.php
Michael:, Okay.,no5-24.php
Jim:, He definitely stole my iPod.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:, That sounds pretty biased.  ,no5-24.php
Jim:,  You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  Okay. Pam, pros.  ",no5-24.php
Jim:, Mm-hmm.,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.",no5-24.php
Jim:, That's not true.,no5-24.php
Michael:, I don't need to tell you that.   ,no5-24.php
Jim:,  I think she'd be a really good salesperson.,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.",no5-24.php
Jim:, And I won't.,no5-24.php
Michael:," Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.",no5-24.php
Jim:,"  All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," Oh, wow!  Whoa!",no5-24.php
Jim:,  Take it easy.,no5-24.php
Michael:," Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--",no5-24.php
Michael:, I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.  ,no5-24.php
Andy:," You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.  ",no5-24.php
Toby:,"  All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.",no5-24.php
Dwight:," Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.",no5-24.php
Toby:,"  All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.",no5-24.php
Dwight:, No.  ,no5-24.php
Toby:, I'm running this meeting.  ,no5-24.php
Dwight:, That's debatable.,no5-24.php
Toby:, It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.  ,no5-24.php
Meredith:," Ooh, where has this guy been?",no5-24.php
Toby:,  Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.  ,no5-24.php
Andy:,  You're running from the problem.,no5-24.php
Toby:,"  There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:,"  Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--",no5-24.php
Pam:,   Just tell me.,no5-24.php
Michael:, I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--,no5-24.php
Pam:," No, okay.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," I'm sorry, sorry.",no5-24.php
Pam:," Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?  ",no5-24.php
Michael:,"  [laughing] Yes, you did.",no5-24.php
Pam:, I did?,no5-24.php
Michael:, Yep.,no5-24.php
Pam:," For real, you're not kidding?",no5-24.php
Michael:," No, you--no.",no5-24.php
Pam:, I did?,no5-24.php
Michael:," No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.  ",no5-24.php
Pam:," Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.  ",no5-24.php
Michael:," [laughing] Oh, oh!",no5-24.php
Pam:, Thank you.  You will not be sorry.,no5-24.php
Michael:," You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.",no5-24.php
Pam:,  Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.,no5-24.php
Michael:," Oh, really?",no5-24.php
Pam:, Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't,no5-24.php
Michael:," Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.",no5-24.php
Pam:, What about Ryan?  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--",no5-24.php
Pam:, Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:," I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.",no5-24.php
Pam:," Thanks, Michael.",no5-24.php
Michael:, Oh! What's our receptionists name?,no5-24.php
Pam:, Erin.,no5-24.php
Michael:,  Could you send her in?  ,no5-24.php
Pam:, [opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.,no5-24.php
Michael:, Hello.,no5-24.php
Erin:, Hi.,no5-24.php
Michael:, Have a seat.  ,no5-24.php
Michael:,"  This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--",no5-24.php
Erin:,"  Oh, I can go.",no5-24.php
Michael:, He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]  ,no5-24.php
Erin:, Oh!,no5-24.php
Michael:," Oh, your face!  Oh!",no5-24.php
Erin:,  Is--do the people--,no5-24.php
Michael:," No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.",no5-24.php
Erin:, Oh!,no5-24.php
Michael:, Oh...,no5-24.php
Erin:,"  Do they not like me, though?",no5-24.php
Michael:," I don't know, actually.",no5-24.php
Erin:, Okay.,no5-24.php
Erin:," Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]",no5-25.php
Erin:, [whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.,no5-25.php
Dwight:, Shut up. ,no5-25.php
Dwight:, [laughs hysterically] I got her!,no5-25.php
Pam:," Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]",no5-25.php
Jim:, Not cool. [Dwight still laughing],no5-25.php
Michael:," [caught by camera crew dancing to ""At the Car Wash"", but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.",no5-25.php
Michael:," Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",no5-25.php
Dwight:, I do.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Okay. How about a woman? Pam?,no5-25.php
Pam:," Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor. ",no5-25.php
Michael:," Oh, really? Ok.",no5-25.php
Pam:, Just sent it.,no5-25.php
Michael:, What about the rest of you? [complete silence],no5-25.php
Michael:," At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.",no5-25.php
Michael:, Who else? Who else? Ryan?,no5-25.php
Ryan:, I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.,no5-25.php
Ryan:," Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.",no5-25.php
Michael:, Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.,no5-25.php
Angela:, No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:," Michael, we have a lot of work to do.",no5-25.php
Michael:, What?,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, Work.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.,no5-25.php
Pam:," If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.",no5-25.php
Pam:," Oh, no. Your battery fell out.",no5-25.php
Michael:, [still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.,no5-25.php
Erin:," Hi, guys. How you doing?",no5-25.php
Dwight:," Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",no5-25.php
Erin:, Right. I'm sorry.,no5-25.php
Dwight:," [sighs] Now, how can I help you?",no5-25.php
Erin:," Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?",no5-25.php
Dwight:," Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court - ",no5-25.php
Pam:, So someone is going to a court. Big deal.,no5-25.php
Dwight:," It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.",no5-25.php
Erin:, Sure.,no5-25.php
Jim:, There are other reasons to go to Ohio.,no5-25.php
Pam:, We're getting married today.,no5-25.php
Jim:," So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.",no5-25.php
Pam:, Tell 'em how it happened.,no5-25.php
Jim:," Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",no5-25.php
Pam:, And very expensive.,no5-25.php
Jim:, Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -,no5-25.php
Pam:, You can't leave anyone out.,no5-25.php
Jim:, No one.,no5-25.php
Pam:," Ok, just get to the good part.",no5-25.php
Jim:," Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, "" You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.""",no5-25.php
Pam:, I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.,no5-25.php
Erin:, Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?,no5-25.php
Michael:, No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.,no5-25.php
Erin:," Well, I like to swim.",no5-25.php
Michael:, That's good.,no5-25.php
Erin:, You have a cool place to come hang.,no5-25.php

Michael:," Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?",no5-25.php
Erin:," Oh, yeah.",no5-25.php
Michael:, You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.,no5-25.php
Erin:, That's rule #1.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Ok. I love it. I love it.,no5-25.php
Erin:, Whew.,no5-25.php
Michael:, I love it.,no5-25.php
Michael:," Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.",no5-25.php
Michael:," Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.",no5-25.php
Michael:,  Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.,no5-25.php
Oscar:, Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.,no5-25.php
Michael:, I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.,no5-25.php
Andy:, [baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Andy's afwaid?,no5-25.php
Andy:, Yes.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Are you all afwaid?,no5-25.php
Dwight:, No.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.,no5-25.php
Pam:, What?,no5-25.php
Michael:, Funk is the problem and the solution.,no5-25.php
Jim:, That makes sense.,no5-25.php
Michael:, I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.,no5-25.php
Oscar:, Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?,no5-25.php
Michael:," Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.",no5-25.php
Dwight:, [Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.,no5-25.php
Meredith:, This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?,no5-25.php
Michael:," No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.",no5-25.php
Andy:, It's like a haunted disco.,no5-25.php
Michael:, ... with coffee but without the haunted.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, It's a combo dance house coffee bar.,no5-25.php
Michael:, It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.,no5-25.php
Erin:, It's a cafe disco.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Exactly.,no5-25.php
Kevin:," So, like, a disco cafe?",no5-25.php
Michael:, Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.,no5-25.php

Michael:, I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?,no5-25.php
Dwight:, What do you think history is?,no5-25.php
Michael:," It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.",no5-25.php

Dwight:, Tell me where it hurts.,no5-25.php
Phylis:, Right... mmmm... right there.,no5-25.php
Dwight:, Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works.

Angela:," Look, I hate to be ""that"" person but I just don't like the general spirit of music. ",no5-25.php
Michael:," I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, "" This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you."" [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.",no5-25.php
Dwight:," This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour. ",no5-25.php
Phyllis:, An hour? I can't stay here an hour.,no5-25.php
Dwight:," Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.",no5-25.php
Creed:," Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.",no5-25.php
Michael:," Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.",no5-25.php
Creed:, No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.,no5-25.php
Dwight:, I'm gonna with the python.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, But the rattler's so scary.,no5-25.php
Dwight:, No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle],no5-25.php
Dwight:, What's so funny?,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh],no5-25.php
Michael:," Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!",no5-25.php
Angela:, You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?,no5-25.php
Michael:, No... cleaning... up.,no5-25.php
Jim:," [waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.",no5-25.php
Pam:, They're beautiful.,no5-25.php
Jim:, You ready?,no5-25.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no5-25.php
Jim:, We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:," Wanna dance, Dwight?",no5-25.php
Dwight:," Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.",no5-25.php
Bob Vance:, Mind if I steal my wife?,no5-25.php
Dwight:, You can't steal what is legally your property.,no5-25.php
Bob Vance:, Are those staples?,no5-25.php
Andy:, This dance competition is not over.,no5-25.php
Kelly:," What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.",no5-25.php
Michael:, You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.,no5-25.php
Jim:, We're gonna stay.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Really?,no5-25.php
Jim:, Yeah. At least for one more dance.,no5-25.php
Michael:," Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to ""Y"".",no5-25.php
Pam:, This is so cheesy.,no5-25.php
Jim:, Yes.,no5-25.php
Pam:, I like cheesy.,no5-25.php
Jim:," Me, too.",no5-25.php
Pam:," Yeah. I think maybe I want a ""wedding"" wedding.",no5-25.php
Jim:," Me, too.",no5-25.php
Pam:, Really?,no5-25.php
Jim:, Yeah.,no5-25.php
Michael:, Would you like to dance?,no5-25.php
Angela:, No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music],no5-25.php
Andy:," Yeah. No. Well, ok.",no5-25.php
Kelly:, Stop squirming.,no5-25.php
Andy:," Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.",no5-25.php
Kelly:, You wanted to do this. Just be brave.,no5-25.php
Andy:," I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.",no5-25.php
Kelly:, I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.,no5-25.php
Andy:," Are you sure that's not the ""gay"" ear?",no5-25.php
Kelly:, Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?,no5-25.php
Andy:," Well, I... ",no5-25.php
Kelly:," Look, I'm gonna count to 3.",no5-25.php
Andy:, Count to twen - count to twenty.,no5-25.php
Kelly:, No. I'm gonna count to 3. ,no5-25.php
Andy:, K,no5-25.php

Kelly:, Yeah. It was.,no5-25.php
Lynn:," Hey, Kevin.",no5-25.php
Kevin:, Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?,no5-25.php
Lynn:, No.,no5-25.php
Kevin:, Oh...cause you smell like bacon.,no5-25.php
Lynn:, I didn't think I did. How's everything going?,no5-25.php
Kevin:, Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.,no5-25.php
Lynn:, Oh.,no5-25.php
Kevin:, I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.,no5-25.php
Lynn:, We can still...,no5-25.php
Kevin:, Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?,no5-25.php
Lynn:, Yes. ,no5-25.php
Kevin:, Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.,no5-25.php
Lynn:," Yes, I had some bacon this morning. I just didn't think it was anyone's business.",no5-25.php
Kevin:, I love the smell of bacon on a woman.,no5-25.php
Kevin:," Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.",no5-25.php
Oscar:," Just go down, Kevin.",no5-25.php
Michael:, My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.,no5-25.php
Stanley:, How did I end up back in Crazytown?,no5-25.php
Dwight:, It is hard to imagine you playing softball.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, I was all-county my junior and senior years.,no5-25.php
Dwight:, Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.,no5-25.php
Phyllis:, The girls school?,no5-25.php
Dwight:," I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say ""girls"" high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.",no5-25.php
Dwight:," [sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say ""Hi"" to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.",no5-25.php
Dwight:, [in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?,no6-03.php
Michael:," No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",no6-03.php
Dwight:, [in Jim's office]  Sign this.,no6-03.php
Jim:," Ah, ah, ah. Where's the ""please""? We're not animals.",no6-03.php
Dwight:, Sign it.,no6-03.php
Jim:," No, not without a ""please.""",no6-03.php
Dwight:, Idiot.,no6-03.php
Dwight:, [in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.,no6-03.php
Michael:, That is not big picture.,no6-03.php
Dwight:," I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",no6-03.php
Michael:, ... Okay.,no6-03.php
Dwight:, Jim won't sign my expense report.,no6-03.php
Michael:, That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.,no6-03.php
Dwight:," No, that is huge.",no6-03.php
Michael:, You're trying to trick me.,no6-03.php
Dwight:, This has to do--,no6-03.php
Michael:," Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",no6-03.php
Dwight:, [in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.,no6-03.php
Jim:, I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, You!,no6-03.php
Jim:, Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, One minute ago.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Okay. And how do you feel?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, Angry.,no6-03.php
Jim:, All right. Did he hit you?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, No.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Did you cry?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, No.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Did you feel like crying?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, No.,no6-03.php
Jim:," I'm just gonna write ""held back tears.""",no6-03.php
Dwight:," Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",no6-03.php
Jim:," If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.",no6-03.php
Dwight:, I'm not cr-- uhh!,no6-03.php
Dwight:," I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah! ",no6-03.php
Erin:," [at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",no6-03.php
Jim:, Michael... ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Yes?,no6-03.php
Jim:, Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,no6-03.php
Michael:," Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",no6-03.php
Stanley:, Can I also be a boss?,no6-03.php
Oscar:," Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes? ",no6-03.php
Jim:, I have noticed that we--,no6-03.php
Michael:, Welcome.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Mm-hmm.,no6-03.php
Jim:," And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--",no6-03.php
Michael:, Disruptive.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Yes.,no6-03.php
Michael:," No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. ",no6-03.php
Jim:," Okay, maybe we should talk specifics. ",no6-03.php
Michael:, Let's do.,no6-03.php
Jim:," Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",no6-03.php
Michael:," N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",no6-03.php
Jim:, I am.,no6-03.php
Michael:," Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets... ",no6-03.php
Jim:, Right.,no6-03.php
Michael:," At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",no6-03.php
Jim:," Yes, I agree. ",no6-03.php
Michael:," Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.,no6-03.php
Michael:," You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",no6-03.php
Jim:, You mean on a weekend?,no6-03.php
Michael:, Yes.,no6-03.php
Jim:, How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Alright. No more meetings this week. ,no6-03.php
Jim:, Really? You just agreed to that?,no6-03.php
Michael:, I can be very suprising.,no6-03.php
Phyllis:, What's going on?,no6-03.php
Pam:," I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.",no6-03.php
Ryan:," You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight. ",no6-03.php
Phyllis:," Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?",no6-03.php
Pam:," We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.",no6-03.php
Pam:," It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash? ",no6-03.php
Phyllis:, Perfect. I hate registries.,no6-03.php
Pam:," Oh, good.",no6-03.php
Phyllis:," My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?",no6-03.php
Pam:," No, we're not.",no6-03.php
Phyllis:, Good. Good.,no6-03.php
Michael:, Mm-hmm?  ,no6-03.php
Jim:," [walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",no6-03.php
Jim:," Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",no6-03.php
Michael:," Stanley, you don't need to answer that.",no6-03.php
Jim:, Stanley?,no6-03.php
Stanley:," ""If you don't smell this, you're fired.""",no6-03.php
Jim:," Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.",no6-03.php
Michael:," What do you mean by ""these people""?",no6-03.php
Jim:," Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",no6-03.php
Jim:, That's not what I meant.,no6-03.php
Michael:," Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",no6-03.php
Jim:, I disagree.,no6-03.php
Michael:, What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time] ,no6-03.php
Jim:," Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",no6-03.php
Michael:," No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. ",no6-03.php
Jim:," That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",no6-03.php
Michael:, That is not what Wallace told us. ,no6-03.php
Jim:, That's exactly what Wallace told us.,no6-03.php
Michael:, That is not the way I heard it.,no6-03.php
Kelly:," I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C.  Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible. ",no6-03.php
Michael:," It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. ",no6-03.php
Jim:," I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",no6-03.php
Michael:," No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.",no6-03.php
Erin:, David Wallace is on line two for you guys. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--,no6-03.php
Jim:," Hey, David. You got Jim here.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager. ",no6-03.php
David Wallace:," Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it. ",no6-03.php
Michael:," Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. ,no6-03.php
David Wallace:, It's probably a little of both. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Which is it more of? ,no6-03.php
David Wallace:, Excuse me?,no6-03.php
Jim:," David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. ",no6-03.php
David Wallace:," Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?",no6-03.php
Michael:, I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. ,no6-03.php
David Wallace:," Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?",no6-03.php
Jim:," Nope, not at all. ",no6-03.php
Michael:," No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",no6-03.php
David Wallace:, Very good. ,no6-03.php
Jim:," Alright, thanks alot, David.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, You don't have to lie. ,no6-03.php
Michael:," I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, Right. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Alright. Let's get started.,no6-03.php
Creed:," Hey, why haven't we ever, um... ",no6-03.php
Meredith:, We have.,no6-03.php
Michael:," You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.",no6-03.php
Jim:," Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",no6-03.php
Michael:," No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",no6-03.php
Jim:, Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. ,no6-03.php
Michael:," Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",no6-03.php
Jim:, It's hard to tell so far.,no6-03.php
Michael:, You use your brain too much.,no6-03.php
Jim:," I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",no6-03.php
Michael:, Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.,no6-03.php
Jim:, You just came up with that.,no6-03.php
Michael:, As I was saying it.,no6-03.php
Jim:," Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit. ",no6-03.php
Michael:, [in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.,no6-03.php
Michael:, Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,no6-03.php
Jim:, Pro-- no favoritism. ,no6-03.php
Michael:," Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.",no6-03.php
Jim:," I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",no6-03.php
Kevin:," Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where. ",no6-03.php
Pam:, I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.,no6-03.php
Kevin:, Like money? Like you-- you want my money?,no6-03.php
Pam:, Mm-hmm.,no6-03.php
Kevin:, Will you take a check?,no6-03.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no6-03.php
Kevin:," Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, ""To love's eternal glory.""",no6-03.php
Pam:, Okay.,no6-03.php
Kevin:, Wait til' Monday. ,no6-03.php
Pam:," Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! ""Mrs. Pam Halpert!"" That's the first time I've seen it in writing!",no6-03.php
Jim:," You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen. ",no6-03.php
Michael:, That will not go over well. ,no6-03.php
Jim:," I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us... ",no6-03.php
Michael:," Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking. ,no6-03.php
Michael:," No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, Michael. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, And then another--,no6-03.php
Jim:," Look, you have a lot of strengths.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Ha! That-- I am not known for that!,no6-03.php
Jim:, But there is a reason why I'm here!,no6-03.php
Michael:, Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,no6-03.php
Jim:," No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",no6-03.php
Michael:," Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",no6-03.php
Jim:, I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!,no6-03.php
Michael:, Ah. ,no6-03.php
Jim:," At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision. ",no6-03.php
Michael:," Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",no6-03.php
Jim:," But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. ",no6-03.php
Michael:," Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",no6-03.php
Jim:, [leave the conference room to address everyone],no6-03.php
Michael:, [to the camera] This had better be terrible. ,no6-03.php
Jim:," Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff. ",no6-03.php
Meredith:, Wait. Seriously?!,no6-03.php
Jim:," Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. ",no6-03.php
Oscar:," Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people. ",no6-03.php
Angela:," But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?",no6-03.php
Oscar:," Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. ",no6-03.php
Jim:," Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. ",no6-03.php
Oscar:, Well?,no6-03.php
Jim:," Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.  ",no6-03.php
Kelly:," [walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on?",no6-03.php
Kevin:, Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen. ,no6-03.php
Kelly:, What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!,no6-03.php
Oscar:," Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?",no6-03.php
Kelly:, No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!,no6-03.php
Dwight:, This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,no6-03.php
Jim:," Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--",no6-03.php
Dwight:," What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!",no6-03.php
Oscar:, Exactly!,no6-03.php
Kevin:, Totally!,no6-03.php
Oscar:, We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. ,no6-03.php
Creed:, Yes. ,no6-03.php
Angela:," Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!",no6-03.php
Meredith:, My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!,no6-03.php
Kevin:, Yeah. ,no6-03.php
Dwight:," Her kid needs shoes, Jim!",no6-03.php

Jim:," Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]",no6-03.php
Michael:," That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--",no6-03.php
Angela:, What are you talking about Michael?,no6-03.php
Stanley:, We just need to hear your plan for our raise. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, My plan-- a man-- panama. ,no6-03.php
Andy:, That's not how that goes. ,no6-03.php
Meredith:, You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...  ,no6-03.php
Jim:," Thank you, Meredith. ",no6-03.php
Meredith:, ...when he was telling us his dumbass plan. ,no6-03.php
Oscar:," We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?",no6-03.php
Michael:," Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. ",no6-03.php
Oscar:," Again, that gives us no information. ",no6-03.php
Phyllis:," This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!",no6-03.php
Michael:, What about a raise based on merit? ,no6-03.php
Jim:, Rank each person individually?,no6-03.php
Michael:," Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. ",no6-03.php
Jim:," [sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]  ",no6-03.php
Michael:, Are you making a--,no6-03.php
Jim:, Nope. I'm numbering the paper. ,no6-03.php
Oscar:, [everyone talking to the camera] Just--,no6-03.php
Kevin:," Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. ",no6-03.php
Angela:, It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting! ,no6-03.php
Meredith:, I am so pissed at this company!,no6-03.php
Dwight:, [out the side of his mouth] And Jim!,no6-03.php
Meredith:, Yeah. Who said that?,no6-03.php
Dwight:, I think it was Creed. ,no6-03.php
Creed:, Yep.,no6-03.php
Jim:," [to camera] It's going really well, actually.   ",no6-03.php
Jim:," [to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]",no6-03.php
Michael:, Toby.,no6-03.php
Jim:, He's not a part of this. You know that. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, Just wanted to draw a picture of him. ,no6-03.php
Jim:," Okay, your move. ",no6-03.php
Michael:, Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick? ,no6-03.php
Jim:, Here we go. ,no6-03.php
Michael:, I... will skip a turn. ,no6-03.php
Jim:," Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",no6-03.php
Michael:, I need more time. ,no6-03.php
Erin:," Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in] ",no6-03.php
Dwight:," People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. ",no6-03.php
Dwight:," Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.",no6-03.php
Oscar:, What the hell?!,no6-03.php
Dwight:, Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager. ,no6-03.php
Michael:," Hey, what are you guys doing in here? ",no6-03.php
Kevin:, What does a bean mean?,no6-03.php
Pam:," Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",no6-03.php
Kevin:," Michael, what does a bean mean?",no6-03.php
Pam:, Jim?,no6-03.php
Jim:, I was just trying to be unbiased.,no6-03.php
Kevin:, What does a bean mean?!,no6-03.php
Oscar:, Someone please explain it to Kevin. ,no6-03.php
Meredith:, Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.,no6-03.php
Phyllis:, Not according to the beans. ,no6-03.php
Angela:, This is how you make this important decision?,no6-03.php
Andy:," There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]  ",no6-03.php
Phyllis:, It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!,no6-03.php
Andy:," Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.",no6-03.php
Phyllis:," Yeah, I would, too. ",no6-03.php
Dwight:," Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!",no6-03.php

Michael:, [in Jim's office] How you doing?,no6-03.php
Jim:," Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.",no6-03.php
Michael:," Oh, what are you usually?",no6-03.php
Jim:, Six. You?,no6-03.php
Michael:," Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. ",no6-03.php
Jim:," I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",no6-03.php
Michael:," I know, I know. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, We tried to find the fairest way to do it. ,no6-03.php
Michael:," Yes, we did. ",no6-03.php
Jim:, I just-- what?,no6-03.php
Michael:," Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]  ",no6-03.php

Michael:," Gin. [toast, sip]  ",no6-03.php
Jim:, Ooh!,no6-03.php
Michael:, [someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here.,no6-03.php
Ryan:, Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?,no6-03.php
Pam:," Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. ",no6-03.php
Ryan:," Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?",no6-03.php
Pam:, $100 now for sure.,no6-03.php
Ryan:," Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift... ",no6-03.php
Pam:," Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.",no6-03.php
Ryan:," Instead of $5,000 a year from now?",no6-03.php
Pam:, How sure is this?,no6-03.php
Pam:, The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.,no6-03.php
Pam:," I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?",no6-04.php
Jim:, We would really appreciate it.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.,no6-04.php
Pam:," Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",no6-04.php
Phyllis:, Now this is getting ridiculous.,no6-04.php
Dwight:," Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.",no6-04.php
Meredith:, All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.,no6-04.php
Pam:, I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.,no6-04.php
Andy:," [Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...

Michael:, [standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,no6-04.php
Jim:, It is really special.,no6-04.php
Pam:," Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.",no6-04.php
Michael:, It's just a really important day for me.,no6-04.php
Jim:," Well, congrats.",no6-04.php

Kevin:," So... you're going to provide them, then?",no6-04.php
Jim:, No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,no6-04.php
Kevin:, What the hell?,no6-04.php
Dwight:, Come on. You've got to be kidding me.,no6-04.php
Pam:, Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,no6-04.php
Jim:, Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.,no6-04.php
Angela:, Decent people everywhere will get offended.,no6-04.php
Pam:," Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.",no6-04.php
Angela:," Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.",no6-04.php
Jim:, That's nice.,no6-04.php
Pam:," You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.",no6-04.php
Angela:," Really, Pam... ",no6-04.php
Michael:, Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela],no6-04.php
Angela:, Ow! He pinched me!,no6-04.php
Michael:, No.,no6-04.php
Pam:, Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, We'll see.,no6-04.php
Pam:," Thank you, Dwight.",no6-04.php
Jim:, Good-bye.,no6-04.php
Pam:, See you later. [others say good-bye],no6-04.php
Michael:," And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",no6-04.php
Andy:," What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]",no6-04.php
Michael:, Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.,no6-04.php
Andy:, No... I didn't steal your joke.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Yes. I said that yesterday.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, But you can say that about anything.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Dwight... ,no6-04.php
Dwight:," What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.",no6-04.php
Kevin:, Oh yeah.,no6-04.php
Michael:," No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.",no6-04.php
Dwight:, It's easy. That's what I'm saying.,no6-04.php
Michael:," This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!",no6-04.php
Michael:, Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Get out of here.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, Yes.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Oh, my God, Dwight.",no6-04.php
Dwight:," For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",no6-04.php
Michael:, There's... a name.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",no6-04.php
Dwight:, Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.,no6-04.php
Micheal:, Ok.,no6-04.php
Dwight:," She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",no6-04.php
Michael:, Is that all you have on her?,no6-04.php
Dwight:," Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",no6-04.php
Michael:, You're an idiot.,no6-04.php
Kevin:," People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.",no6-04.php
Andy:," [in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",no6-04.php
Kelly:, This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.,no6-04.php
Andy:, Mmm-hmm. Erin?,no6-04.php
Erin:, Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.,no6-04.php
Andy:, Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.,no6-04.php
Pam:," [in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",no6-04.php
Jim:, Yeah?,no6-04.php
Pam:, She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.,no6-04.php
Jim:," Oh, wow. That's cool.",no6-04.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no6-04.php
Jim:," [aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.",no6-04.php
Pam:, Oh.,no6-04.php
Jim:, Lousy Picture.,no6-04.php
Pam:, We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.,no6-04.php
Michael:," [in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.",no6-04.php

Dwight:, Mmm-hmm.,no6-04.php
Michael:, That was nice of you.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",no6-04.php
Dwight:," You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] ""Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes.

Michael:," Well, who's that one?",no6-04.php
Dwight:," Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.",no6-04.php
Michael:," What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",no6-04.php
Dwight:, That's a very good record.,no6-04.php
Pete:," Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.",no6-04.php
Tom:," That's when I'll do the face, like-",no6-04.php
Pete:," Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--",no6-04.php
Tom:, A noogie?,no6-04.php
Pete:, You know what? Never too married for a noogie.,no6-04.php
Michael:," They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.",no6-04.php
Tom:," Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine.",no6-04.php
Pete:, Smoking.,no6-04.php
Tom:, Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch.,no6-04.php
Pete:, A little mo' cardio.,no6-04.php
Michael:," That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",no6-04.php
Dwight:, Knight Rider.,no6-04.php
Michael:, That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.,no6-04.php
Dwight:, No.,no6-04.php
Michael:," That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]",no6-04.php
Dwight:, Very smart.,no6-04.php
Michael:, And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,no6-04.php
Jim:, No.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Yeah. Go ahead.,no6-04.php
Jim:," Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.",no6-04.php
Pete:, Douche.,no6-04.php
Jim:," Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",no6-04.php
Pam:, Like... a year.,no6-04.php
Jim:," I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--",no6-04.php
Mema:, What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?,no6-04.php
Jim:," Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.",no6-04.php
Michael:," [clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--",no6-04.php
Mema:, They were living together?,no6-04.php
Michael:," Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.",no6-04.php
Jim:, Michael.,no6-04.php
Michael:," When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.",no6-04.php
Jim:," Oh, my God. Please.",no6-04.php
Michael:, When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--,no6-04.php
Pam:, Michael.,no6-04.php
Michael:, ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.,no6-04.php
Pam:, Michael. Stop.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",no6-04.php
Jim:, Alright.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Jim.,no6-04.php
Jim:, To waiting.,no6-04.php
Everyone:, [quiet and scattered] To waiting.,no6-04.php
Mema:," I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called ""Bruno"" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know.",no6-04.php
Pam:, Mema.,no6-04.php
Michael:, That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.,no6-04.php
Jim:, I can't believe it was me.,no6-04.php
Michael:," I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",no6-04.php
Jim:, Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?,no6-04.php
Michael:, I have not found that to be the case.,no6-04.php
Pam:," Hey, smooth guys.",no6-04.php
Jim:, I'm so sorry.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",no6-04.php
Pam:, Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.,no6-04.php

Michael:, There's gonna be a free room?,no6-04.php
Michael:," Hi, Mema. It's Michael.",no6-04.php
Mema:, Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?,no6-04.php
Michael:," I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.",no6-04.php
Mema:, I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]",no6-04.php
Mema:, Oh. Thank you.,no6-04.php
Michael:, You're welcome.,no6-04.php
Mema:, It was that horrible Charlie Rose.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.",no6-04.php
Mema:, People are like cats and dogs these days.,no6-04.php
Michael:, Exactly.,no6-04.php
Mema:, This used to be such a great country.,no6-04.php
Michael:, I know.,no6-04.php
Mema:, I don't know what happened to it.,no6-04.php
Michael:," They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.",no6-04.php

Kevin:, Yes!,no6-04.php
Andy:," Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.",no6-04.php
Kevin:, That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?,no6-04.php
Andy:, Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!,no6-04.php
Andy:, No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.,no6-04.php
Andy:," If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.",no6-04.php

Dwight:," What? It's a casual, social outfit.",no6-04.php
Michael:," Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.",no6-04.php
Dwight:, No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.,no6-04.php
Michael:," Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]",no6-04.php
Kevin:, It's a good idea.,no6-04.php
Oscar:, It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.,no6-04.php
Kevin:," Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.",no6-04.php
Dwight:," I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.",no6-04.php
Michael:," Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.",no6-04.php
Isabel:, Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have?,no6-04.php
Dwight:, Nine and three-quarters.,no6-04.php
Dwight:," I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.",no6-04.php

Erin:,  Do you think they canceled the wedding?  ,no6-04.php

Pam:, Saw it. ,no6-04.php
Jim:,"  I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.  ",no6-04.php
Kevin:,"  What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.

Pam:," Hi, Michael.",no6-06.php
Michael:," Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.",no6-06.php
Michael:, Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans],no6-06.php
Meredith:, So what'd you bring us?,no6-06.php
Pam:, Some candy.,no6-06.php

Dwight:, This conversation has two items on the agenda.,no6-06.php
Jim:, Do we have a conversation scheduled?,no6-06.php
Dwight:," Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!",no6-06.php
Jim:," Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. ",no6-06.php
Dwight:," [duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]",no6-06.php
Dwight:," I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing. ",no6-06.php
Dwight:, I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years. ,no6-06.php
Jim:, It's a real handsome duck. ,no6-06.php
Dwight:," Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair. ",no6-06.php
Pam:, Hey!,no6-06.php

Jim:, You did not have sex with Pam's mom.,no6-06.php
Michael:," Oh, big time.",no6-06.php
Jim:, What kind of car does she drive?,no6-06.php
Michael:, She drives a green camry.,no6-06.php
Jim:, [expletive],no6-06.php
Michael:, And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,no6-06.php
Jim:, Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God. ,no6-06.php
Michael:, [laughs] What?,no6-06.php
Jim:," Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",no6-06.php
Michael:," Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",no6-06.php

Toby:, What did I do?  ,no6-06.php
Jim:," Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again. ",no6-06.php
Michael:," I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",no6-06.php
Jim:," No, not more than anything. ",no6-06.php
Michael:," Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",no6-06.php
Jim:," Don't call her ""the mom.""",no6-06.php
Michael:, She's right on my way home from work.,no6-06.php
Jim:," Then take a different way home, man! ",no6-06.php
Michael:," I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.",no6-06.php
Jim:," Okay, so we're good.",no6-06.php
Michael:, Yeah.,no6-06.php
Michael:, Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,no6-06.php
Erin:," Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?",no6-06.php
Michael:, Sure. Thanks for asking.,no6-06.php
Erin:," Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum.",no6-06.php
Jim:, Frank and beans!,no6-06.php
Pam:," Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",no6-06.php
Jim:, You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,no6-06.php
Pam:," Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?",no6-06.php
Jim:," You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. ",no6-06.php
Pam:," Come on, it'll take two seconds.",no6-06.php
Jim:," No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]",no6-06.php

Jim:," Yes, you do.",no6-06.php
Michael:," No, I don't.",no6-06.php
Jim:, Just take the parrot.,no6-06.php
Michael:, [long exhale],no6-06.php
Jim:," Okay, back to the old grind.",no6-06.php
Michael:, I was probably going to break up with her anyway.,no6-06.php
Pam:," Oh, that's too bad.",no6-06.php
Jim:, Don't-,no6-06.php
Michael:," Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. ",no6-06.php

Pam:," Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.",no6-06.php
Michael:, You want me to be happy?,no6-06.php
Pam:, Of course.,no6-06.php

Jim:, [singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?,no6-06.php
Pam:, Thank you.,no6-06.php
Jim:," [sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",no6-06.php
Pam:, You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.,no6-06.php

Michael:,"  [in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.",no6-06.php
Andy:,  Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?  ,no6-06.php
Michael:,"  That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.  ",no6-06.php
Pam:,  Haha!  Ha ha ha.  ,no6-06.php

Toby:,"  Yeah, sure, what's up?",no6-06.php
Michael:,"  Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.  ",no6-06.php
Toby:,"  Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.",no6-06.php
Michael:,  Can I sit down for a second?,no6-06.php
Toby:,"  Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.  ",no6-06.php
Michael:,"  This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.",no6-06.php
Toby:,"  Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.  ",no6-06.php
Michael:,  She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.,no6-06.php
Toby:,"  Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.  ",no6-06.php
Michael:,  Really?  Would you do that?  ,no6-06.php
Toby:,  Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh],no6-06.php
Michael:,"  [hugs Toby, who smiles big] You're a good, good guy.",no6-06.php
Toby:,  I'm good... ,no6-06.php
Toby:,"  You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.  ",no6-06.php
Toby:,"  [walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?",no6-06.php
Pam:,"  Sure, what's up?  ",no6-06.php
Toby:,"  Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.  ",no6-06.php
Pam:,"  [to Michael] What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?  ",no6-06.php
Michael:,  No... that's... ,no6-06.php
Toby:,  Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know... ,no6-06.php
Pam:,"  [to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?  ",no6-06.php
Michael:,  I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.  ,no6-06.php
Pam:,  You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.,no6-06.php
Toby:,"   [gets up and puts a hand on Michael's shoulder] Buddy, I think that... ",no6-06.php
Michael:,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.  ",no6-06.php
Stanley:,"  Heh, heh, heh.  ",no6-06.php
Pam:,"  Michael, you're just her rebound!",no6-06.php

Pam:,"  Mmmmm, yes!",no6-06.php
Michael:,"  Well, that is not gonna happen!",no6-06.php
Pam:,  Then why'd you even offer!?,no6-06.php
Michael:,  Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.,no6-06.php
Pam:,"  Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!",no6-06.php
Michael:,  You know what?  I'm gonna start dating her even harder.,no6-06.php
Pam:,  What's that supposed to mean?  ,no6-06.php
Michael:,  You know what it means.  ,no6-06.php
Jim:,  [Pam storms out of the break room] Hey... ,no6-06.php
Pam:,  Shut it!,no6-06.php
Jim:,  Yep... ,no6-06.php

Jim:,  A wooden duck?,no6-06.php
Dwight:,  Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.  ,no6-06.php
Jim:,"  Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage... ",no6-06.php
Dwight:,"  Oh, I'm equipped... I can...",no6-06.php

Pam:,"  [looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?  ",no6-06.php
Jim:,"  Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.  ",no6-06.php
Pam:,  Mmmm.,no6-06.php

Jim:,"  Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!  ",no6-06.php

Jim:,  Yeah... maybe.,no6-06.php
Pam:,  But I don't think I am.  ,no6-06.php
Jim:,"  You're not, nope.  Nope.  ",no6-06.php

Michael:, It is the easy way out. You are not alone.,no6-07.php
Darryl:, What the hell is wrong with you?,no6-07.php
Michael:, Who wants candy?,no6-07.php
Michael:, ...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.,no6-07.php
Jim:, Wow.,no6-07.php
Michael:, Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.,no6-07.php
Jim:, I bet we would.,no6-07.php
Michael:, They have a TCBY booth.,no6-07.php
Jim:, Cool.,no6-07.php
Michael:, The same stuff you get downtown.,no6-07.php

Michael:, Wha- what?,no6-07.php
Jim:, They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.,no6-07.php

Jim:," Yes, it is.",no6-07.php
Michael:, ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.,no6-07.php

Michael:, Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.,no6-07.php
Oscar:," Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?",no6-07.php
Jim:, Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.,no6-07.php
Michael:, It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.,no6-07.php
Angela:, So you fell in?,no6-07.php
Michael:, No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.,no6-07.php
Angela:, So a child had fallen in?,no6-07.php
Michael:, Not yet!,no6-07.php
Kevin:, That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump],no6-07.php
Michael:," No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]",no6-07.php
Jim:," Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.",no6-07.php
Pam:, And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.,no6-07.php

Customer:, My mistake. Sorry.,no6-07.php
Pam:, It's ok.,no6-07.php

Customer:, That- that's good for you.,no6-07.php
Pam:," Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.",no6-07.php
Andy:," Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.",no6-07.php
Pam:, Yeah.,no6-07.php
Pam:, You were way meaner to me than I was to you.,no6-07.php
Andy:, No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.,no6-07.php
Pam:," You blew the sale, you idiot.",no6-07.php
Andy:, Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.,no6-07.php
Michael:," Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?",no6-07.php
Erin:," Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.",no6-07.php
Michael:, Oh. He did? What did he say?,no6-07.php
Erin:," He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.",no6-07.php

Michael:, Ok.,no6-07.php
Dwight:, Michael?,no6-07.php
Michael:, Yes.,no6-07.php

Phyllis:," And when you fell in, did you flounder?",no6-07.php
Dwight:," Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -",no6-07.php
Michael:, I know what a flounder is.,no6-07.php
Michael:, I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.,no6-07.php
Michael:, The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?,no6-07.php
Phyllis:," Michael, you make fun of us every day.",no6-07.php
Michael:, Uh... ,no6-07.php
Kevin:, Yeah. Every single day.,no6-07.php
Michael:, You never said anything.,no6-07.php
Meredith:," Uh, we have. Countless times.",no6-07.php
Michael:," Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'",no6-07.php
Angela:, That's never the case.,no6-07.php
Michael:," We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.",no6-07.php
Dwight:, I don't want people making fun of my nose.,no6-07.php
Michael:, Your nose?,no6-07.php
Dwight:, It's too small.,no6-07.php
Michael:, Alright.,no6-07.php

Kelly:, What keeps your glasses on?,no6-07.php
Dwight:," Hey! It's on the list, everybody.",no6-07.php
Michael:, No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.,no6-07.php
Kevin:, I don't want people making fun of my weight.,no6-07.php
Michael:, Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? [writes Huge Gut] Meredith?,no6-07.php
Meredith:, I don't want to say it out loud.,no6-07.php
Michael:, Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.,no6-07.php
Meredith:, I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist'],no6-07.php
Michael:, Ok.,no6-07.php
Andy:, That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it. ,no6-07.php
Keena Gifford:," Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple.",no6-07.php
Andy:, Well- ,no6-07.php
Pam:, Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.,no6-07.php
Keena Gifford:, Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do.,no6-07.php
Pam:," Well, you know.",no6-07.php
Andy:, Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook- ,no6-07.php
Pam:, He loves to eat.,no6-07.php
Andy:, I love to dance- ,no6-07.php
Pam:, I love to watch him dance.,no6-07.php
Andy:, Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room- ,no6-07.php
Pam:, And I'll just watch him.,no6-07.php
Keena Gifford:, And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.,no6-07.php
Pam:, Yes.,no6-07.php
Andy:, Yeah. We are thrilled.,no6-07.php
Pam:, Mmm-hmm.,no6-07.php
Andy:," In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?",no6-07.php
Pam:," It was, sweetie.",no6-07.php
Keena Gifford:, Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.,no6-07.php
Andy:, Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.,no6-07.php
Keena Gifford:, Yeah!,no6-07.php
Andy:, Yeah.,no6-07.php
Angela:," This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.",no6-07.php
Phyllis:," So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?",no6-07.php
Erin:," Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]",no6-07.php
Michael:, It's a fish.,no6-07.php
Erin:, They want you to pay for it.,no6-07.php
Michael:, It could've died of natural causes. So... ,no6-07.php
Erin:," Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.",no6-07.php
Oscar:, When is the funeral?,no6-07.php
Michael:," Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?",no6-07.php
Erin:,$300.00 ,no6-07.php
Michael:, What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. ,no6-07.php
Creed:," Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?",no6-07.php
Jim:," Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.",no6-07.php
Michael:," No, no.",no6-07.php

Michael:, No. We are not done here. This- ,no6-07.php
Andy:," One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!",no6-07.php

Andy:," Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]",no6-07.php
Pam:, Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.,no6-07.php
Andy:," Message received, little soy bean.",no6-07.php
Jim:," I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.",no6-07.php
Michael:," No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'. ",no6-07.php
Jim:," No, they don't.",no6-07.php
Michael:," Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.",no6-07.php

Michael:, I got thirsty. ,no6-08.php
Pam:," Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.",no6-08.php
Michael:,"  Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.  ",no6-08.php
Pam:,  Cakes really good.  ,no6-08.php

Michael:,"  I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.  ",no6-08.php
Michael:,"  Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.  ",no6-08.php
Pam:,"  Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.",no6-08.php
Michael:,  No it's not.  ,no6-08.php

Michael:,  Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.  ,no6-08.php
Pam:, Well-- ,no6-08.php
Michael:," [covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I've never-- I don't know him.  There's another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.  ",no6-08.php
Jim:,"  Okay, so-- ",no6-08.php
Michael:," And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.  ",no6-08.php

Andy:,  What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.,no6-08.php
Dwight:," Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.",no6-08.php
Andy:, It's like a little envelope-- there you go.,no6-08.php
Dwight:, Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.  ,no6-08.php
Andy:, Surprise! [laughs]  It's from everybody.  $15 value.,no6-08.php
Dwight:,  Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.,no6-08.php

Pam:,  I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.,no6-08.php
Michael:,"  That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.",no6-08.php

Michael:,  Do you want the raise or what?,no6-08.php
Pam:,"  Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]",no6-08.php

Michael:, Okay.  ,no6-08.php
Jim:,  And I don't support her choice to hit you.  ,no6-08.php
Michael:, I don't either.,no6-08.php
Jim:,  But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.  ,no6-08.php
Michael:, Mmm-hmm.  I know.  ,no6-08.php
Jim:,  I just need some time.,no6-08.php
Michael:, You gotta do something-- ,no6-08.php
Jim:,  I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.,no6-08.php
Michael:, How much time do you think you'll need?,no6-08.php
Jim:, No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.  ,no6-08.php
Michael:," Come on, man!",no6-08.php
Toby:," Pam, can I talk to you for a second?",no6-08.php
Pam:, Oh... ,no6-08.php

Pam:,  Right.  ,no6-08.php
Toby:,"  Okay, I think we should probably be okay.",no6-08.php
Pam:, Okay.,no6-08.php
Toby:,  Okay.  And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot.  So its-- its all one motion through the-- body.  So you stay a little low and there's a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!,no6-08.php

Kevin:,  Michael could win.,no6-08.php
Oscar:,  How?  He can't hit back.  ,no6-08.php
Kevin:,  Why can't you just agree with me sometimes? ,no6-08.php
Michael:, Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let's do this.  ,no6-08.php
Michael:, It's okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.,no6-08.php
Kevin:,"  We're here for the show, Michael.  ",no6-08.php

Michael:, So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.  ,no6-08.php
Pam:,  How about for dating my mom?,no6-08.php
Michael:, Maybe that-- ,no6-08.php
Pam:,  And dumping her on her birthday.,no6-08.php
Michael:, Yes.,no6-08.php
Pam:,  Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.  ,no6-08.php
Michael:,  Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]  ,no6-08.php
Phyllis:,  Holy crap.,no6-08.php
Pam:,  Are you okay?,no6-08.php
Michael:, No!,no6-08.php
Pam:,  You're okay.,no6-08.php
Jim:,  Feel better?,no6-08.php
Pam:, No.  You were right.,no6-08.php
Dwight:," [walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?",no6-08.php
Michael:,  I don't know.,no6-08.php
Dwight:,  Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.,no6-08.php
Michael:," As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.",no6-08.php
Michael:, Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face],no6-08.php
Dwight:,"  Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.",no6-08.php
Michael:, Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.    ,no6-08.php
Dwight:,  Fire Jim.,no6-08.php
Michael:,  No.,no6-08.php
Dwight:, I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.,no6-08.php
Michael:, What are you talking about-- ,no6-08.php
Dwight:, Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.  ,no6-08.php
Michael:,  Forget that.,no6-08.php
Dwight:,  Can I have an office?,no6-08.php
Michael:,  No.,no6-08.php
Dwight:,  You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.  ,no6-08.php

Dwight:,"  How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?

Jim:,"  OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!",no6-09.php
Kevin:,  No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.,no6-09.php
Dwight:,  False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!,no6-09.php
Jim:,"  OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,  That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.,no6-09.php
Jim:,"  So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",no6-09.php
Dwight:,  Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist] ,no6-09.php
Jim:,"  And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!",no6-09.php
Jim:,"  Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.",no6-09.php

Oscar:,"  Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.",no6-09.php

Meredith:, Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.,no6-09.php
Pam:,  I do not.,no6-09.php
Andy:,"  Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.",no6-09.php
Kevin:," Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.",no6-09.php
Andy:,"  Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?",no6-09.php

Phyllis:,"  You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!",no6-09.php
Michael:,"  No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.",no6-09.php

Angela:," It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,  I know you did it!,no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.",no6-09.php
Kevin:,  [in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.,no6-09.php

Erin:,"  Yeah, my boudoir's always open.",no6-09.php
Kevin:,  Nice.,no6-09.php
Andy:,"  I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.",no6-09.php
Oscar:,"  I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.",no6-09.php
Phyllis:,  What does that mean?,no6-09.php
Oscar:," Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-",no6-09.php

Oscar:,"  [tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.

Jim:,"  OK, I'm going back to work.",no6-09.php
Michael:,  No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.,no6-09.php

Phyllis:,"  Michael, I was doing so well.",no6-09.php
Michael:,"  [accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?",no6-09.php
Jim:,"  OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.",no6-09.php

Jim:,"  No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.",no6-09.php
Michael:,  No it ain't.,no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.",no6-09.php

Erin:, No. [laughs] Did you?,no6-09.php
Andy:,  Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away],no6-09.php
Erin:,"  I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?",no6-09.php
Michael:," I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.",no6-09.php
Michael:,"  This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.",no6-09.php

Michael:,  You are-,no6-09.php
Pam:,  I think Michael may have snapped.,no6-09.php
Jim:,  Or maybe he's just stuck in character.,no6-09.php
Pam:,"  Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",no6-09.php
Jim:,  Both.  They're both worse.,no6-09.php
Jim:,"  It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.",no6-09.php
Pam:,"  Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.",no6-09.php
Michael:,"  [comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?",no6-09.php
Jim:,"  Michael, not now.",no6-09.php

Oscar:,  You're not gonna answer the phone?,no6-09.php

Jim:,"  Oh, OK.",no6-09.php
David:,"  But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?",no6-09.php

Stanley:,  Super.,no6-09.php
Dwight:,"  Oh, this could be a juicy one.",no6-09.php
Michael:,  Get in there!,no6-09.php
Jim:,"  I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.",no6-09.php
Michael:,"  There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.  ",no6-09.php

Jim:," Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",no6-10.php
Dwight:," Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?",no6-10.php
Jim:, The next year he really stepped things up.,no6-10.php
Dwight:, Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?,no6-10.php
Jim:, A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,no6-10.php
Dwight:, Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns. ,no6-10.php
Jim:, Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.,no6-10.php
Dwight:, Recyclops will have his revenge.,no6-10.php
Jim:, I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.,no6-10.php
Pam:," Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.",no6-10.php
Dwight:, Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office],no6-10.php
Stanley:," Oh, is today Recyclops Day?",no6-10.php
Dwight:, Yes.,no6-10.php
Stanley:, I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.,no6-10.php
Dwight:, Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something],no6-10.php
Andy:, That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.,no6-10.php
Dwight:, Humans are terrible for the environment.,no6-10.php
Pam:, The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.,no6-10.php
Jim:, Mmm.,no6-10.php
Pam:, A world where you truly can be anything you want.,no6-10.php
Jim:," God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]",no6-10.php

Meredith:, And it looks like you're taking a dump.,no6-10.php
Michael:," Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors.

Phyllis:," Yeah, good. Don't do it. ",no6-10.php
Michael:," I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.",no6-10.php
Oscar:, The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.,no6-10.php
Michael:," Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",no6-10.php
Oscar:, Those are the bullet points.,no6-10.php

Kevin:," [at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.",no6-10.php
Michael:, They sent a limo.,no6-10.php
Michael:, Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.,no6-10.php
Michael:," [everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",no6-10.php
Dwight:, What kind of mileage does this baby get?,no6-10.php
Erin:, It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.,no6-10.php

Michael:, Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.,no6-10.php

Ryan:," The company's probably going under, though.",no6-10.php
Jim:, Could go either way.,no6-10.php
Ryan:, Seems like it's leaning one way.,no6-10.php
Jim:, Maybe we should just wait and find out.,no6-10.php
Ryan:, Definitely.,no6-10.php
Jim:, Ok.,no6-10.php
Ryan:, So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?,no6-10.php
Jim:, Nah. Might as well do it now.,no6-10.php
Andy:," Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?",no6-10.php

Phyllis:," Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.",no6-10.php
Jim:, I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.,no6-10.php

Pam:," Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.",no6-10.php
Jim:," Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.",no6-10.php

Jim:, Mmm-hmm.,no6-10.php
Ryan:, That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.,no6-10.php
Jim:," Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.",no6-10.php

Jim:," I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention.

Ryan:, Mmm-hmm.,no6-10.php

O'Keefe:, He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?,no6-10.php

Michael:, [zipping through the hall while texting],no6-10.php
Michael:," Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.'  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early.

Kelly:, What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin],no6-12.php

Michael:," If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably ""freedom.""

Pam:, This is like the Cadillac of pumps.,no6-20.php
Meredith:, Give it back to me now.,no6-20.php
Pam:," Okay, I was just warming it up.",no6-20.php
Meredith:, It's disgusting!,no6-20.php
Pam:, It's not a big deal.,no6-20.php
Meredith:, It's not sterile!,no6-20.php
Andy:, We're both girls. Who cares?,no6-20.php
Erin:, So... how was lunch?,no6-20.php
Andy:, Lunch was fine.,no6-20.php
Erin:, Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?,no6-20.php
Andy:," I don't know. It was lunch, Andy. ",no6-20.php
Oscar:," Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles] ",no6-20.php
Erin:, Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets. ,no6-20.php
Kelly:," God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.",no6-20.php
Ryan:," [using a Cookie Monster voice] ""My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant."" See I did the voice.",no6-20.php
Kelly:, That's a little derivative.,no6-20.php
Ryan:, But parody is always derivative. ,no6-20.php
Pam:," Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?",no6-20.php
Jim:, Jim does a really good one. Do yours.,no6-20.php
Gabe:," Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. ""Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall."" ",no6-20.php
Jim:," Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?",no6-20.php
Gabe:," ""Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.""",no6-20.php
Andy:, Ok.,no6-20.php
Michael:," Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.",no6-20.php
Andy:," You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..",no6-20.php
Michael:, I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.,no6-20.php
Andy:, No. No. No. ,no6-20.php
Michael:, Specific shout-out..,no6-20.php
Andy:, Stop talking.,no6-20.php
Erin:," Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..",no6-20.php
Michael:, [throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.,no6-20.php
Andy:, Oh God.,no6-20.php
Erin:, Can we talk about this in private?,no6-20.php
Andy:, I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?,no6-20.php
Erin:, Yes.,no6-20.php
Pam:, Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?,no6-20.php
Erin:," No, no never.",no6-20.php
Dwight:, Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?,no6-20.php
Erin:, Yeah pretty much.,no6-20.php
Gabe:, Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave],no6-20.php
Kevin:," I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.",no6-20.php
Erin:," Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you. ",no6-20.php
Kevin:, Thanks.,no6-20.php
Pam:," So if you need anything, I'm right over there. ",no6-20.php
Gabe:," [imitating Cookie Monster] ""Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.""",no6-20.php

Jim:," What? What do you mean, suspend me?",no6-20.php
Gabe:, I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.,no6-20.php
Dwight:," Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.",no6-20.php
Gabe:," Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",no6-20.php
Kevin:, I don't want to hear it. Suspended.,no6-20.php
Andy:," ""C"" is for suspension.",no6-20.php
Michael:, Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?,no6-20.php
Andy:," Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",no6-20.php
Michael:," I was going to tell her, just on my own time.",no6-20.php
Andy:," You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.",no6-20.php
Angela:," Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things. ",no6-20.php
Erin:, Psst. Hey. Erin.,no6-20.php
Angela:," You want to talk to me, come to my desk.",no6-20.php
Erin:, You embarrassed me earlier. ,no6-20.php
Angela:, Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.,no6-20.php
Erin:, You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.,no6-20.php
Angela:, I want to throw up just thinking about it. ,no6-20.php
Toby:, You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!,no6-20.php
Pam:," [standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.",no6-20.php
Erin:, Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.,no6-20.php
Pam:, Really?,no6-20.php
Erin:, Yeah. And he worked here too.,no6-20.php
Pam:," It was Andy, wasn't it?",no6-20.php
Erin:," No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",no6-20.php
Pam:, I hope you find what you're looking for.,no6-20.php
Gabe:, Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek],no6-20.php
Pam:, [talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.,no6-20.php
Toby:, [answers phone] Hey Toby.,no6-20.php
Pam:," I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.",no6-20.php
Toby:, Very interesting.,no6-20.php
Pam:," Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...",no6-20.php
Gabe:, [Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.,no6-20.php
Pam:," Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. ",no6-20.php
Jim:, I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. ,no6-20.php
Dwight:," And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. ",no6-20.php
Gabe:," [gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.",no6-20.php
Dwight:, Great. ,no6-20.php
Gabe:, [gets on one knee] I kneel before you.,no6-20.php
Dwight:," Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. ",no6-20.php
Gabe:, Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. ,no6-20.php
Erin:," [following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]",no6-20.php
Andy:, Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?,no6-20.php
Erin:," Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.",no6-20.php
Andy:, How long were you guys together?,no6-20.php
Erin:, A year.,no6-20.php
Andy:, A year? You were together for a year?,no6-20.php
Erin:, Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...,no6-20.php
Andy:, I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?,no6-20.php
Gabe:, I didn't see that movie.,no6-20.php
Kelly:, [walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.,no6-20.php
Gabe:, Do they still get paid?,no6-20.php
Oscar:, It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.,no6-20.php
Meredith:, Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.,no6-20.php
Gabe:, Pathetic.,no6-20.php
Dwight:," Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] ""Or cookies.""",no6-20.php
Gabe:, What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,no6-20.php
Kevin:, Alright.,no6-20.php
Gabe:," [imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person. ",no6-20.php
Dwight:, You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang. ,no6-20.php
Kevin:," ""I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.""",no6-20.php
Gabe:," ""Ciao"" Right? ""Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.""",no6-20.php
Erin:, Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao],no6-20.php
Michael:, [sitting on bench outside groaning],no6-20.php
Erin:, Erin?,no6-20.php
Michael:, Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.,no6-20.php
Erin:," No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",no6-20.php
Michael:, I can't trust Andy anymore.,no6-20.php
Erin:, Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing. ,no6-20.php
Michael:, It's Andy's fault. ,no6-20.php
Erin:," Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis. ",no6-20.php
Michael:," Oh, I like his butt.",no6-20.php
Erin:, You said butt.,no6-20.php
Michael:, You tricked me!,no6-20.php
Andy:," Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.",no6-20.php
Oscar's voice from the computer:, Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost.,no6-20.php
Kevin:, I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.,no6-20.php
Phyllis:, I don't get it.,no6-20.php
Jim:," Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",no6-20.php
Pam:," Yeah. ""I vant to count to ten"".",no6-20.php
Kevin:," But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.",no6-20.php
Kelly:, But you're an accountant too.,no6-20.php
Oscar:, Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?,no6-20.php
Pam:, That would have been funny.,no6-20.php
Kevin:, But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple. ,no6-20.php
Michael:," [walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? ""Oscar. I am the Count."" Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",no6-20.php

Jim:," You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",no6-22.php
Jim:," [chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you. ",no6-22.php
Pam:, Yup. That's exactly what we did. ,no6-22.php
Dwight:," It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, ""I will when you lose the baby weight."" ",no6-22.php

Michael:," Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",no6-22.php
Stanley:," Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt.

[all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.",no6-22.php
Michael:, I have an idea for your weekend.,no6-22.php
Stanley:, Okay.,no6-22.php
Michael:, Let me get back to my desk right now. ,no6-22.php

Michael:, Eel fishing.,no6-22.php
Darryl:, All right.,no6-22.php
Meredith:, Curl up with your favorite DVD.,no6-22.php
Michael:, You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three. ,no6-22.php
Kelly:," We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's. ",no6-22.php
Michael:," Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.",no6-22.php
Kelly:," Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, ""I wanna go to Mount Pocono,"" you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI. ",no6-22.php
Michael:," Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?",no6-22.php
Ryan:, Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she... ,no6-22.php
Michael:," Yeah, she does all that.",no6-22.php
Ryan:," Sorry, dude.",no6-22.php
Michael:," No, no... ",no6-22.php
Pam:," Michael, do not let your imagination run amok. ",no6-22.php

Michael:," Why didn't you just say that, Pam? ",no6-22.php
Pam:," Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control. ",no6-22.php
Michael:," Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. ",no6-22.php
Jim:, You do?,no6-22.php
Michael:," Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. ",no6-22.php
Jim:, But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago. ,no6-22.php
Michael:, That's what makes it so wrong. ,no6-22.php
Michael:," Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me. ",no6-22.php
Dwight:," Oh, God, that tickles. What did... ",no6-22.php
Michael:, [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. ,no6-22.php

Andy:," Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire. ",no6-22.php
Gabe:, That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.,no6-22.php
Andy:, What are we gonna do about this? ,no6-22.php
Gabe:," I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.",no6-22.php

Darryl:, You didn't feel like he was hiding something?,no6-22.php
Andy:, I don't know.,no6-22.php
Darryl:, Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.,no6-22.php
Darryl:," Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said ""Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."" [smiles]",no6-22.php

Donna:, Right.,no6-22.php
Dwight:, Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands],no6-22.php
Donna:," Donna, hi. ",no6-22.php
Dwight:," All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",no6-22.php
Jim:," That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",no6-22.php
Michael:," It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives. ",no6-22.php

Jim:," Michael, no... ",no6-22.php
Pam:," No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",no6-22.php
Michael:, It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok. ,no6-22.php
Pam:," Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",no6-22.php
Michael:," God, this is so disgusting. ",no6-22.php
Pam:, Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you. ,no6-22.php

Dwight:," What? No, she didn't say that.",no6-22.php
Michael:," You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] ""What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.""

Carroll:, You didn't call my office and ask where I was?,no7-04.php

Andy:, The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.,no7-04.php
Gabe:," I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.",no7-04.php
Michael:, Oh wow another living room!,no7-04.php

Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me.

Darryl:," Oh, I never sing with soul.",no7-05.php
Andy:, That's a lie.,no7-05.php
Kevin:, I could sing it.,no7-05.php

Danny:, But from where?,no7-05.php

Kelly:, [bleep] me!,no7-05.php
Michael:," O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",no7-05.php

Phyllis:, It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.,no7-05.php
Michael:," No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.",no7-05.php
Dwight:, Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.,no7-05.php
Michael:," He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",no7-05.php

Jim:," No. No, I'm not gonna-no.",no7-06.php
Andy:, Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?,no7-06.php
Jim:, I don't care.,no7-06.php
Kevin:, I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.,no7-06.php
Andy:, You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in],no7-06.php
Kevin:," Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.",no7-06.php

Darryl:," Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]",no7-06.php
Pam:," [leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.",no7-06.php
Michael:, This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,no7-06.php
Angela:," So, what happened?",no7-06.php
Michael:," I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...",no7-06.php
Erin:, Oh! [fumbles for phone],no7-06.php
Michael:, And we are going to straighten this out.,no7-06.php
Andy:, Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.,no7-06.php
Michael:, Mmhm!,no7-06.php
Gabe:," Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]",no7-06.php
Michael:, I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.,no7-06.php
Dwight:, He went to Gabe behind your back.,no7-06.php
Michael:," No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.",no7-06.php
Dwight:, He went over your head to go behind your back. ,no7-06.php
Michael:, What is taking someone from behind?,no7-06.php
Dwight:," No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous. ",no7-06.php
Michael:," It was a good idea, though.",no7-06.php
Dwight:, Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea. ,no7-06.php
Andy:," Hey, Danny.",no7-06.php
Danny:, Hey.,no7-06.php
Andy:," I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.",no7-06.php

Angela:," Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?",no7-06.php

Dwight:," Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!",no7-06.php
Michael:, [staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?,no7-06.php
Dwight:," Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.",no7-06.php
Michael:," Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",no7-06.php
Kevin:, I am so sorry.,no7-06.php
Michael:," Oh, you're sorry? ",no7-06.php
Kevin:, I just thought-,no7-06.php
Michael:, What did you just thought? ,no7-06.php
Kevin:," Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry] ",no7-06.php
Michael:, All right.,no7-06.php
Kevin:, I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.,no7-06.php
Michael:, Okay.,no7-06.php
Kevin:, Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.,no7-06.php
Michael:," Well, don't let it happen again.",no7-06.php
Kevin:, [hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.,no7-06.php

Kevin:," [bleep] you, Gabe!",no7-06.php
Gabe:, Okay...,no7-06.php
Danny:, Can you imagine? It's just crazy.,no7-06.php
Jim:, That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,no7-06.php
Danny:," Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.",no7-06.php
Pam:," Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.",no7-06.php
Danny:, Exactly.,no7-06.php
Jim:, It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about? ,no7-06.php
Danny:, No! Two or three dates.,no7-06.php
Pam:, It was two.,no7-06.php
Danny:, Was it two? I thought it was three.,no7-06.php
Pam:," No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...",no7-06.php
Jim:, Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs],no7-06.php
Danny:," [laughing] Well, that does not sound like me. ",no7-06.php
Pam:," Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened. ",no7-06.php
Danny:," [stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.",no7-06.php
Pam:, Hmm-mm.,no7-06.php
Michael:," Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",no7-06.php
Darryl:, I'm not mad. Are you mad?,no7-06.php
Michael:, You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,no7-06.php
Darryl:," Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.",no7-06.php
Michael:," Okay, that might help. If you said ""I'm sorry"" in front of everybody.",no7-06.php
Darryl:, Mike.,no7-06.php
Michael:, In front of me.,no7-06.php
Darryl:, You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.,no7-06.php

Stanley:, How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?,no7-06.php
Oscar:, I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.,no7-06.php
Phyllis:, Oh.,no7-06.php
Oscar:, Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.,no7-06.php
Ryan:," Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.",no7-06.php
Pam:," Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",no7-06.php
Kevin:, Pam. Can you vote for other people?,no7-06.php
Michael:," Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",no7-06.php
Michael:, Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.,no7-06.php
Pam:," Michael, this is a bad idea.",no7-06.php
Michael:, What's a bad idea?,no7-06.php
Pam:," Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",no7-06.php
Michael:," NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.",no7-06.php
Kelly:, Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?,no7-06.php
Stanley:, [walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword],no7-06.php
Oscar:," I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.",no7-06.php
Pam:, Angela as the nurse!,no7-06.php

Phyllis:, What should we ask?,no7-06.php
Michael:," Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",no7-06.php
Jim:, We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?,no7-06.php
Erin:, He says no.,no7-06.php
Michael:, Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.,no7-06.php
Darryl:, No.,no7-06.php
Michael:," Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",no7-06.php
Dwight:, Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.,no7-06.php
Dwight:," I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth. ",no7-06.php

Erin:, [hands are being forced to the letters] A... S... S... H... E... T?,no7-06.php

Todd Packer:, I don't think you get it.,no7-06.php
Danny:, Hey.,no7-06.php
Jim:, Hey.,no7-06.php
Danny:," This is some party, huh?",no7-06.php
Jim:," When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?",no7-06.php
Danny:, Are you serious?,no7-06.php
Jim:," Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...",no7-06.php
Danny:," You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...",no7-06.php
Jim:, Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,no7-06.php
Todd Packer:," Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?",no7-06.php
Jim:, Nope. ,no7-06.php
Danny:, Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.,no7-06.php
Ryan:, Fifty seven. Fifty eight. ,no7-06.php
Meredith:," Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.",no7-06.php

Pam:, I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.,no7-06.php
Jim:, Just tell her the real reason.,no7-06.php
Danny:, Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?,no7-06.php
Jim:, Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,no7-06.php
Pam:," I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like ""gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.""",no7-06.php
Danny:, Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky. ,no7-06.php

Gabe:," Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open. ",no7-06.php
Michael:," If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!",no7-06.php
Darryl:, You said no to this one!,no7-06.php

Darryl:, What have you done for me?,no7-06.php
Michael:, Oh...,no7-06.php
Darryl:, What have you done for me? ,no7-06.php
Michael:, Well...,no7-06.php
Darryl:, Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.,no7-06.php
Gabe:," Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?",no7-06.php
Michael:," Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.",no7-06.php
Gabe:, Yeah.,no7-06.php
Michael:," You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",no7-06.php
Darryl:, I don't understand the point of a hat.,no7-06.php
Gabe:," You're right, we don't need a hat.",no7-06.php
Michael:, I am not budging on the hat issue.,no7-06.php
Gabe:," Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.",no7-06.php
Michael:, Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,no7-06.php
Gabe:," Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.",no7-06.php
Michael:," Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.",no7-06.php
Darryl:, Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.,no7-06.php

Andy:," When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards. ",no7-06.php
Darryl:, This was your freshman year.,no7-06.php
Andy:," I started to ask myself, ""Do I have big plans here?"" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.",no7-06.php
Darryl:, No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.,no7-06.php

Kelly:, I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.,no7-07.php

Jim:, Stop.,no7-07.php
Michael:," [under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.",no7-07.php
Pam:, One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,no7-07.php
Erin:, Di-Did you say vampire?,no7-07.php
Pam:," Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]",no7-07.php
Dwight:, Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.,no7-07.php

Dwight:, [rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh... ,no7-07.php
Pam:," And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",no7-07.php
Dwight:," NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",no7-07.php
Jim:, Elaborate.,no7-07.php
Dwight:," The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter... ",no7-07.php
Pam:, I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.,no7-07.php
Dwight:, Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,no7-07.php

Dwight:, Yes. I would welcome it.,no7-07.php
Jim:," [sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.",no7-07.php
